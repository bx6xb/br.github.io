          professionally as Pop Smoke, was an American rapper. Born and raised
          in Brooklyn, New York City, Pop Smoke began his musical career in late
          2018 with his debut single "MPR (Panic Part 3 Remix)". He rose to fame
          with the release of his breakout singles "Welcome to the Party" and
          "Dior" in 2019. He often collaborated with UK drill artists and
          producers, who employed more minimal and aggressive instrumentation
          than American drill artists from Chicago, reintroducing the sound as
          Brooklyn drill.
