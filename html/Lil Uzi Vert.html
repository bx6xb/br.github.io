              <hr />
              Symere Bysil Woods, born July 31 1995, known professionally as Lil
              Uzi Vert, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. They are
              characterized by their facial tattoos, facial piercings, eccentric
              hairstyles and androgynous fashion, imagery built on a melodic
              approach to trap. Born and raised in Philadelphia, Lil Uzi Vert
              gained initial recognition following the release of the commercial
              mixtape Luv Is Rage (2015), which led to a recording contract with
              Atlantic Records, to whom they signed under DJ Drama's Generation
              Now imprint. <br /><br />
              Lil Uzi Vert attracted mainstream attention following the release
              of their debut single "Money Longer" in 2016. The song would act
              as the lead single for the subsequent mixtape Lil Uzi Vert vs. the
              World (2016), which also contained the song "You Was Right". After
              releasing two additional mixtapes in 2016 and 2017, including one
              in collaboration with Gucci Mane, Lil Uzi Vert was featured on the
              Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping Migos' single "Bad and Boujee".
              They later secured their first top ten single with "XO Tour
              Llif3", which won the MTV Video Music Award for Song of Summer.
              <br /><br />
              "XO Tour Llif3" acted as the lead single to Lil Uzi Vert's debut
              studio album Luv Is Rage 2 (2017), which debuted at number one on
              the Billboard 200, and was certified double platinum by the
              Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 2018
              Grammy Awards, Lil Uzi Vert was nominated for Best New Artist.
              Their second studio album, Eternal Atake (2020), was among the
              most anticipated albums in contemporary trap and rap when it was
              finally released following years' worth of delays. Eternal Atake,
              like Luv Is Rage 2, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.
              <div class="text-header">Early life</div>
              <hr />
              Symere Woods was born July 31, 1995, in North Philadelphia's
              Francisville neighborhood. They grew up listening to Mike Jones
              and Ying Yang Twins; Jones' debut album was the first album they
              purchased. Woods later began listening to Wiz Khalifa and Meek
              Mill, who influenced their future style. They also began listening
              to Marilyn Manson, Paramore, Smash Mouth, The Rocket Summer,
              Simian, My Chemical Romance, and The All-American Rejects when
              they were 13 years old, and have said they are a "big Marilyn
              Manson fan" and called Mechanical Animals their favorite album.
              <br /><br />
              Woods began rapping in tenth grade, calling themself a "regular
              kid, I didn't really wanna rap", after hearing classmate William
              Aston freestyle over a remade Chris Brown instrumental. Woods,
              Aston and another friend created a rap group, Steaktown, which
              broke up when Woods was 17. <br /><br />
              Woods dropped out of school and soon started working at a Bottom
              Dollar store, but they quit after four days and were kicked out of
              their home by their mother. The situation led to Woods getting
              their first face tattoo, the word "Faith" under their hairline,
              which provoked them to take their rap career seriously.
              <br /><br />
              In July 2021, Woods revealed on a tweet that their birth
              certificate shows they were born in 1995, after erroneously
              believing they were born one year earlier.

              <span>2010â€“2015: Career beginnings</span><br /><br />
              Woods began to rap in 2010 and began to associate with musical
              groups like Steaktown and in what they say was "just for money"
              under the name "Sealab Vertical". They later changed their name to
              Lil Uzi Vert from the way someone described their rap flow, saying
              their flow was "Fast, like a machine gun." Woods' first project,
              an EP titled Purple Thoughtz Vol. 1 was released on January 19,
              2014. The project, which was described as "phonk" and having cloud
              rap beats from The Guardian due to its psychedelic and "trippy"
              production features Woods with a bigger focus on lyricism than
              most of their career and was released with the single "White Shit"
              which included a video. The track, which was produced by
              Spaceghostpurrp, went viral in 2017 within hip-hop circles
              following Wood's entry into the mainstream. Shortly after the
              release of Purple Thoughtz Vol. 1, Woods caught the attention of
              then industry-mainstays like the ASAP Mob. <br /><br />
              The project and following features caught the attention of
              producer and Def Jam A&R Don Cannon after DJ Diamond Kuts played
              one of Woods' songs on a local radio station, who signed Woods to
              their The Academy imprint and produced their first mixtape, The
              Real Uzi which was released on August 5, 2014. After the release
              of The Real Uzi, Woods signed a record deal with Atlantic Records
              through DJ Drama, Don Cannon's and Leighton Morrison's imprint,
              Generation Now. <br /><br />
              Following their signing to Atlantic Records, Woods was featured
              alongside Rich the Kid and ASAP Ferg on Carnage's single "WDYW".
              They also released several songs on SoundCloud including the Metro
              Boomin produced "No Wait", "Pressure" which is a collaboration
              with Lil Durk and "Dej Loaf". They were featured on Fall Out Boy
              and Wiz Khalifa's "Boys of Zummer" tour in August 2015. Woods
              released their second mixtape, Luv Is Rage on October 30, 2015.
              The project, which features production from then-bubbling
              producers such as Sonny Digital, TM88 and Maaly Raw with features
              from Billboard charting rappers such as Wiz Khalifa and Young
              Thug, was received positively and was featured on numerous music
              blogs such as Fader, XXL and Vibe. They were further called a
              "breakout artist of 2015" by HotNewHipHop. <br /><br />
              <span>2016: Breakthrough</span><br /><br />
              In January 2016, Lil Uzi appeared at an A$AP Mob show in New York
              City to honor the deceased ASAP Yams. In February, they released
              the single, "Money Longer" on their SoundCloud following a radio
              debut on Shade 45. Controversy arose in March 2016 after a riot
              broke out at SXSW's final day during Woods set. On April 15, 2016,
              Uzi released their third mixtape and first commercial mixtape Lil
              Uzi Vert vs. the World. The mixtape debuted at number 37 on the
              Billboard 200 chart, making its Woods first entry on the chart.
              The project spent 55 weeks on the Billboard 200 album chart,
              eventually being certified Gold. Woods and Kodak Black embarked on
              a joint tour in May 2016, titled the "Parental Advisory" tour.
              <br /><br />
              In June 2016, Lil Uzi Vert appeared in XXL magazine as part of
              their 2016 Freshman Class. As part of this appearance, Uzi
              performed a â€˜freshman cypherâ€™ alongside Denzel Curry, Lil Yachty,
              21 Savage, and Kodak Black. As of December 2021, this cypher has
              received over 195 million YouTube views, by far the most for the
              XXL channel. Riding the wave of recognition the XXL Freshman list
              gave them, Woods released the video for the single "Money Longer"
              which debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 the following week, their
              first entry on the chart, at number 92 on July 2, 2016. The song
              later peaked at number 54 and is currently certified two-times
              platinum in the United States. Woods second entry on the chart,
              Metro Boomin produced "You Was Right" debuted at 89 on July 30,
              2016, and peaked at number 40. <br /><br />
              On July 12, 2016, Woods announced their fourth mixtape, The
              Perfect LUV Tape, which was released on July 31, their 22nd
              birthday. The mixtape featured the singles "Seven Million",
              featuring Future, and "Erase Your Social", both of which failed to
              chart on the Billboard Hot 100. The mixtape debuted at number 55
              on the Billboard 200 album chart and is certified Gold by the
              RIAA. In October 2016, Woods was announced to be an additional
              artist on Canadian singer the Weeknd's tour. <br /><br />
              Woods announced a collaboration mixtape with Gucci Mane which was
              released on November 23, 2016. On the 27th, Woods announced Luv Is
              Rage 2 which eventually went through a series of delays.

              Uzi featured on the hip-hop trio Migos' single "Bad and Boujee".
              The single was released on October 28, 2016, and is from the
              trio's second studio album, Culture (2017). In January 2017,
              around the time the album released, the single peaked atop the US
              Billboard Hot 100, becoming Uzi's first number 1 single as a lead
              or featured artist, and their highest-charting single as both. On
              February 27, 2017, Woods released the EP Luv Is Rage 1.5 while on
              tour with the Weeknd. The EP was positively received for its
              "nerdy" nature with Kingdom Hearts themed instrumentals and lyrics
              referring to anime, Steven Universe and hentai. The EP was also
              credited as the start of Woods' affiliation with the "Emo rapper"
              label due to the heartbreak-associated lyrics on the song "Luv
              Scars K.o 1600" and references to threats of suicide and
              depression on the stand-out track "XO Tour Llif3". <br /><br />
              "XO Tour Llif3"'s significant popularity on SoundCloud resulted in
              Woods playing it live on the European leg of the Weeknd's tourand
              the following week the song was added to streaming services and
              released as an official single.On April 4, 2017, "Xo Tour Llif3"
              debuted on Billboard Hot 100 at number 49 and peaked at number
              seven, becoming the rapper's highest-charting song and biggest
              song, being certified six-times platinum as of August 2018.
              <br /><br />
              Luv Is Rage 2 was delayed again on April 2, 2017, with Woods
              blaming it on DJ Drama. On April 9, Don Cannon confirmed the
              project wasn't getting released "any time soon" and confirmed that
              "XO Tour Llif3" would be on the album. Uzi was featured on fellow
              rapper Playboi Carti's single "Woke Up Like This". It was released
              on April 7, 2017, and is from Carti's debut commercial mixtape,
              Playboi Carti (2017). The single was performed by the pair at
              Coachella 2017. <br /><br />
              "Woke Up Like This" was eventually certified platinum and peaked
              at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100. Uzi was featured alongside
              ASAP Rocky, Playboi Carti, Quavo and Frank Ocean on ASAP rappers
              collective ASAP Mob's single "Raf". The single was released by
              surprise on May 15, 2017, and is from the collective's second
              studio album, Cozy Tapes Vol. 2: Too Cozy. In early August,
              hip-hop media personality DJ Akademiks claimed that Luv Is Rage 2
              would release within 30 days. On August 24, 2017, Luv Is Rage 2
              was announced for a surprise release at midnight and on August 25,
              2017, Lil Uzi Vert released their heavily delayed debut studio
              album, Luv Is Rage 2, which included top ten single, "XO TOUR
              Llif3" as the lead single. <br /><br />
              The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart,
              with 135,000 album-equivalent units and has since been certified
              platinum. The album also created ten Billboard Hot 100 charting
              singles, with two, "The Way Life Goes", featuring Oh Wonder, and
              "Sauce It Up" becoming singles. During British singer Ed Sheeran's
              set at the Video Music Awards, Woods and Sheeran performed a
              medley of "XO Tour Llif3" and Sheeran's chart-topping single,
              "Shape Of You". <br /><br />
              In September 2017, Woods teased a possible sequel project to Lil
              Uzi Vert vs The World possibly titled Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World 2
              and a collaboration project with Playboi Carti titled 16*29. In
              October, a joint-tour with Playboi Carti called the "16*29 tour"
              was announced further promoting the possibility of a collaboration
              project. The tour was cancelled shortly thereafter due to Woods
              claiming they needed to "focus". In October 2017, Woods headlined
              Power 105.1's annual Powerhouse music celebration, alongside the
              Weeknd, Migos, and Cardi B, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn,
              New York. Woods was also featured on Canadian rapper Nav's
              platinum-certified single "Wanted You". The song was released on
              November 3, 2017, Nav's 28th birthday, and is from Nav's debut
              studio album, Reckless (2018). <br /><br />
              On December 4, 2017, "The Way Life Goes" music video was released
              with a remix, featuring Trinidadian-American rapper Nicki Minaj.
              The song subsequently peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Hot
              100. Woods performed on Stephen Colbert's The Late Show performing
              "The Way Life Goes" on February 6, 2018 Uzi was featured alongside
              Kanye West on Travis Scott's song, "Watch", which was released on
              May 3, 2018. "Watch" debuted at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100
              chart. They were also featured on a remix for fellow rapper Lil
              Tracy's single "Like a Farmer". <br /><br />

                >2018â€“2020: Eternal Atake, Lil Uzi Vert vs. The World 2, and
                Pluto x Baby Pluto</span
              ><br /><br />
              In January 2018, Uzi announced that they had completed a mixtape
              with record producer Wheezy. In May 2018, Don Cannon confirmed
              that a new Uzi project was dropping in 2018 and speculation arose
              in July 2018 when Woods tweeted the words "Eternal Atake", their
              second studio album (2020), pinning the tweet and announcing it
              was "coming soon" and then at the end of the month sharing the
              then-chosen cover art for the project. The then-chosen cover art
              for Eternal Atake references the logo of the cult Heavens Gate.
              The two members who survived the cult suggested that legal actions
              could be taken against Uzi for copying the logo style.
              <br /><br />
              The art was the source of a threat from the two remaining members
              of the organization over legal attack. The then-thought lead
              single from Eternal Atake, "New Patek" was released on September
              18, 2018. Uzi was then featured on Lil Pump's single, "Multi
              Millionaire". The single was released on October 5, 2018, and is
              from Pump's second studio album, Harverd Dropout. <br /><br />
              In April 2019, following label trouble with Generation Now, it was
              announced that Uzi was now signed to Roc Nation. Two new
              promotional singles were released in April 2019, titled "Sanguine
              Paradise" and "That's a Rack", originally thought to be from their
              highly anticipated studio album, Eternal Atake. <br /><br />
              On December 13, 2019, Uzi released a new single titled, "Futsal
              Shuffle 2020", which is the lead single of Eternal Atake. They
              then released the second single of the album, titled "That Way",
              on March 1, 2020. Eternal Atake was released on March 6, 2020,
              with a sole guest appearance from American singer Syd. The release
              date of the album was a week earlier then fans expected it to
              release. "New Patek", "That's a Rack" and "Sanguine Paradise" did
              not appear on the album. Eternal Atake debuted atop the Billboard
              200. <br /><br />
              On March 12, 2020, Lil Uzi teased that the deluxe version of
              Eternal Atake and the sequel to their July 2016 mixtape, Lil Uzi
              Vert vs. the World, titled Lil Uzi Vert vs. the World 2, would
              release the following day, the date fans expected the release date
              of the original album. The deluxe edition would have fourteen new
              tracks, featuring guest appearances from Chief Keef, 21 Savage,
              Future, Young Thug, Gunna, Lil Durk, Young Nudy and Nav. The first
              half of the album maintained a leading number 1 position (equal to
              288,000 album sales in the United States) with 400 million streams
              in early 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. This marked the
              largest streaming count for any album since 2018 when Lil Wayne's
              twelfth studio album, Tha Carter V, got 433 million streams.
              <br /><br />
              On April 24, 2020, Lil Uzi Vert released a new single titled
              "Sasuke", the first since the release of the deluxe version of
              Eternal Atake. On July 10, 2020, Lil Uzi appeared on the remix of
              StaySolidRocky's "Party Girl". On July 21, 2020, Lil Uzi and
              Future hinted at an upcoming joint project titled Pluto x Baby
              Pluto on their social media. The two later released two new
              singles, "Patek" and "Over Your Head", on July 31, which was Uzi's
              26th birthday. Pluto x Baby Pluto was released on November 13,
              2020, and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200. A deluxe
              version containing the two previously released singles as well as
              6 new tracks was released 4 days later on November 17.
              <br /><br />
              <span>2021â€“present: The Pink Tape</span><br /><br />
              In late 2020, Lil Uzi Vert began promoting new singles on
              Instagram live that were sonically similar to popular releases
              early in their career. They subsequently announced an upcoming
              project titled Forever Young, as well as a follow-up to Luv Is
              Rage 2 and a project to be released exclusively on SoundCloud. On
              October 29, 2021, Lil Uzi Vert released the single "Demon High",
              Awhich is expected to be the lead single to their upcoming album
              The Pink Tape, which they have been teasing to their fans since
              December 2020. In April 2022, Woods had two guest appearances on
              the deluxe edition of American rapper Yeat's 2 Alive album,
              appearing as the featured on the songs "Big Tonka" and "3G".
              <br /><br />
              On July 12, 2022, Uzi announced an EP titled Red & White, which
              was meant to be released prior to The Pink Tape. The EP was
              released ten days later, with Uzi releasing a number of highly
              anticipated tracks exclusively on SoundCloud in the lead-up to its
              release. In September 2022, Uzi again collaborated with Yeat,
              appearing as a featured artist on Yeat's September 2022 EP Lyfe,
              featuring on the EP's opening track "Flawless". In October 2022,
              they released their single "Just Wanna Rock", which had gone viral
              on the video-sharing app TikTok. "Just Wanna Rock", a Jersey
              Club-inspired song with production from Synthetic and rising
              Jersey Club producer McVertt, peaked at number 10 on the Billboard
              Hot 100, their highest charting single since the rollout of
              Eternal Atake.
