              <hr />
              Bashar Barakah Jackson (July 20, 1999 – February 19, 2020), known
              professionally as Pop Smoke, was an American rapper. Born and
              raised in Brooklyn, New York City, Pop Smoke began his musical
              career in late 2018 with his debut single "MPR (Panic Part 3
              Remix)". He rose to fame with the release of his breakout singles
              "Welcome to the Party" and "Dior" in 2019. He often collaborated
              with UK drill artists and producers, who employed more minimal and
              aggressive instrumentation than American drill artists from
              Chicago, reintroducing the sound as Brooklyn drill.
              <br /><br />
              Following his rise to fame, record producer Rico Beats introduced
              Pop Smoke to Steven Victor in April 2019. Victor would later have
              Pop Smoke sign a recording contract with Victor Victor Worldwide
              and Republic Records. He released his debut mixtape Meet the Woo
              in July 2019. His second mixtape, Meet the Woo 2, was released on
              February 7, 2020, and debuted at number seven on the Billboard
              200, becoming the rapper's first top-10 project in the United
              States. <br /><br />
              Twelve days after the mixtape's release, Pop Smoke was murdered
              during a home invasion in Los Angeles. New York rapper 50 Cent was
              the executive producer of his posthumous debut studio album, Shoot
              for the Stars, Aim for the Moon, released on July 3, 2020. The
              album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and all 19 tracks
              from the album were charted on the Billboard Hot 100. The album
              also spawned a string of international top-10 singles, including
              "For the Night" (featuring DaBaby and Lil Baby) and "What You Know
              Bout Love". A year later, Republic Records released Pop Smoke's
              second studio album, Faith, on July 16, 2021.
              <div class="text-header">Early life</div>
              <hr />
              Bashar Barakah Jackson was born on July 20, 1999, in Brooklyn, New
              York City, to a Jamaican mother, Audrey Jackson, and a Panamanian
              father, Greg Jackson. He had an older brother named Obasi. Jackson
              attended nine different schools while growing up in Canarsie,
              Brooklyn. He played the African drums in his local church as a
              child. <br /><br />
              Jackson was expelled from eighth grade for bringing a gun to
              school. He spent two years on house arrest after being charged
              with possessing a weapon. Jackson started playing basketball as a
              point and shooting guard. He relocated to Philadelphia to enroll
              in Rocktop Academy. He was later forced to leave after being
              diagnosed with a heart murmur, and Jackson eventually turned to
              street life.
              <div class="text-header">Career</div>
              <hr />
              In a Genius interview, he stated that his artist name of Pop Smoke
              is a combination of Poppa, a name given to him by his Panamanian
              grandmother, and Smocco Guwop, a nickname from childhood friends
              and it was also his old Instagram name. He first attempted rapping
              during a 2018 visit to a Brooklyn recording studio with Jay
              Gwuapo. In late 2018, he was rapping over a beat from 808Melo's
              YouTube channel, Jackson recorded a track titled "MPR (Panic Part
              3 Remix)" during the session. On January 28, 2019, he released
              "Flexin'". Meanwhile, Jackson befriended producer Rico Beats, who
              was acquainted with record executive Steven Victor.
              <br /><br />
              The three set up an interview, and in April 2019, Jackson signed
              to Victor Victor Worldwide and Republic Records. On April 23,
              2019, Jackson released his breakout single, "Welcome to the
              Party", that was produced by 808Melo. Many remixes of the song
              were later recorded, with the commercially released versions
              featuring Nicki Minaj and the other featuring Skepta. Jackson
              released his debut mixtape Meet the Woo on July 26, 2019. From
              October to December 2019, Jackson released multiple singles,
              including "War" with Lil Tjay, and "100k on a Coupe" with Calboy.
              <br /><br />
              On December 27, 2019, Jackson appeared on Travis Scott's Cactus
              Jack Records compilation album JackBoys on the song "Gatti" which
              was also accompanied by a music video. "Gatti" debuted and peaked
              at number 69 on the US Billboard Hot 100, giving Jackson his first
              Hot 100 appearance. On January 16, 2020, Jackson released
              "Christopher Walking". On February 7, 2020, twelve days before his
              death, Jackson released his second mixtape Meet the Woo 2, with
              features from Quavo, A Boogie wit da Hoodie, Fivio Foreign and Lil
              Tjay.
              <br /><br />
              The mixtape debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200,
              earning Jackson his first top-10 hit in the United States. Five
              days after its release, a deluxe edition was released with three
              new songs, each featuring a guest appearance, consisting of Nav,
              Gunna, and PnB Rock. Jackson teased to social media his debut
              headlining concert tour Meet the Woo Tour to promote both his
              mixtapes. The tour was planned to begin in the US in March, and
              end in the UK in April.
              <div class="text-header">Posthumous releases</div>
              <hr />
              "Dior", the second single off Meet the Woo, became Jackson's first
              posthumous solo hit, peaking at number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100
              and number 33 on the UK Singles Chart. At the beginning of March
              2020, American rapper 50 Cent announced on his Instagram that he
              had decided to executive produce and finish Jackson's debut studio
              album. After his announcement, 50 Cent called artists like Roddy
              Ricch, Drake, and Chris Brown wanting to feature them on the
              record. Pop Smoke had wanted to take his mother to an awards show
              prompting 50 Cent to promise to take her to one when the album was
              complete.
              <br /><br />
              On April 16, 2020, a documentary on Pop Smoke's life was announced
              to be in the works. On May 14, 2020, Victor announced that Pop
              Smoke's debut studio album would be posthumously released on June
              12, 2020. The album was named Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the
              Moon. It was originally set for release on June 12, 2020, but was
              pushed back out of respect for the George Floyd protests. Instead,
              on the album's original release date, the lead single, "Make It
              Rain", featuring fellow Brooklyn rapper Rowdy Rebel was released.
              <br /><br />
              Rebel's verse was recorded through a collect call since he was
              incarcerated at the time. Virgil Abloh created the album's
              original artwork. The cover artwork provoked significant criticism
              from fans who called it "lazy" and "rushed" and felt it was
              disrespectful. It prompted a Change.org petition attracting tens
              of thousands of signatures. Ryder Ripps created the final cover
              art with the chrome rose against a black background. Jackson's
              mother chose the final album cover hours before the album was
              released commercially.
              <br /><br />
              The album was officially released on July 3, 2020, to commercial
              success, reaching number one in several countries, including on
              the Billboard 200. All 19 songs on the album charted on the
              Billboard Hot 100, with "For the Night" featuring Lil Baby and
              DaBaby, debuting and peaking at number six, giving Pop Smoke his
              first top-10 hit in the US. On July 20, 2020, which what would
              have been Jackson's 21st birthday, a deluxe edition of the album
              was released, and featured 15 new additional tracks. <br /><br />
              The album's fifth single "What You Know Bout Love", ended up
              peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Pop Smoke
              his second top-10 hit in the US. On February 26, 2021, "AP" was
              released as the lead single for the Boogie soundtrack. Pop Smoke
              was cast as Monk in a minor role for Boogie. <br /><br />
              Without assistance from 50 Cent, a second posthumous album titled
              Faith was released on July 16, 2021, to mixed reviews. It debuted
              at number one on the Billboard 200, making Pop Smoke the first
              artist to have their first two posthumous albums debut at the top
              of the chart. A deluxe version, featuring four additional tracks,
              was released on July 20, 2021, which what would have been
              Jackson's 22nd birthday. Six more tracks were added on July 30.

              <hr />
              On January 17, 2020, after returning from Paris Fashion Week,
              Jackson was arrested by federal authorities at John F. Kennedy
              International Airport after stealing a Rolls-Royce Wraith, valued
              at $375,000, whose owner reported it stolen after Jackson had
              reportedly borrowed it in California for a music video shoot on
              the condition it would be returned the next day. Investigators
              believed he arranged for the car to be transported on a flatbed
              truck to New York. He posted a photo of himself in front of the
              stolen car on Instagram and Facebook. The car was recovered by
              authorities at Jackson's mother's house, in the Canarsie section
              of Brooklyn.
              <br /><br />
              After his arrest, police questioned him about a non-fatal shooting
              that took place in Brooklyn in June 2019. The police thought he
              had information on the shooting because they claimed to have
              footage of him driving a car in reverse near the scene of the
              crime. The police also tried to pressure Jackson into telling them
              more information about the Crips, GS9, and other Brooklyn street
              gangs, but he refused to talk.
              <br /><br />
              He was charged with grand theft auto, posted a $250,000 bond, and
              agreed to stay away from known gang members and submit drug tests
              to the US pretrial services. The conditions Jackson was put under
              hindered some of his performances like the "BK Drip Concert" at
              Kings Theatre in Flatbush in February 2020, as gang members were
              in the audience.
              <div class="text-header">Death</div>
              <hr />
              On February 19, 2020, Jackson was renting a house through Airbnb
              owned by The Real Housewives star Teddi Mellencamp and her
              husband, Edwin Arroyave, in Hollywood Hills, California. At around
              4:30 a.m., five hooded men, including one wearing a ski mask and
              carrying a handgun, broke into the house through a second-story
              balcony while Jackson was taking a shower (it is unclear if
              Jackson was in the shower or not). The intruders held a gun to a
              woman's head and threatened to kill her. Shortly thereafter, the
              woman heard the men shoot Jackson three times after an
              altercation. <br /><br />
              The LAPD received news of the home invasion from a call from the
              East Coast. Police arrived at the home six minutes later and found
              Jackson with multiple gunshot wounds. He was rushed to
              Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where doctors performed a thoracotomy
              on the left side of his chest.A few hours later, he was pronounced
              dead. He was 20 years old. On February 21, the Los Angeles County
              Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner revealed that the cause of
              Jackson's death was a gunshot wound to the torso. <br /><br />
              The LAPD at first suspected that Jackson's death was gang-related,
              as he was tied to the Crips. However, the LAPD later believed his
              death was the consequence of a home robbery gone wrong. It was
              believed the intruders stole Jackson's gold watch and other
              jewelry before running away from the house. In May 2021, a
              15-year-old, the youngest of the four intruders, allegedly
              admitted to killing Jackson over a diamond-studded Rolex during a
              recorded interview with a cellmate at a juvenile detention center.
              The 15-year-old told the cellmate that Jackson at first complied
              with their requests for jewelry but then tried to fight them, and
              a confrontation broke out in which Jackson was pistol-whipped and
              shot with a Beretta M92. The intruders made off with his Rolex,
              which they sold for $2,000.
              <br /><br />
              The day before his murder, Jackson and friend Michael Durodola
              posted several images on social media, including one in which
              Mellencamp's home address can be seen in the background. The
              rapper also posted a story on Instagram and Facebook of gifts he
              had received. One showed the house's full address on the
              packaging, giving out its location. <br /><br />
              Jackson's body was originally planned to be buried at the Cypress
              Hills Cemetery but was later changed to Green-Wood Cemetery.
              Family, friends, and fans of Jackson gathered in his hometown of
              Canarsie, Brooklyn, to show their respects. His casket was pulled
              in a horse-drawn carriage and was surrounded by glass windows and
              white curtains. On September 11, 2021, it was discovered that his
              grave site was vandalized, with the headstone smashed.
              <br /><br />
              On July 9, 2020, three adult men and two minors were arrested for
              the murder of the rapper. One of the adult suspects has been
              charged with murder with a special circumstance that alleged the
              killing was committed "during the commission of a robbery and a
              burglary", and another charged with attempted murder. The two
              juveniles were charged with murder and robbery in juvenile court.
              As California law requires a minor to be at least 16 at the time
              of the crime, the 15-year-old could not be tried as an adult; and,
              under George Gascón's policy to keep all juveniles in juvenile
              court, the 17-year-old could not be tried as an adult, either.
              <br /><br />
              <span>Remembrance</span> <br /><br />
              Jackson's parents, Audrey and Greg Jackson, shared memories of
              their son before saying how gun violence took him away from them.
              <br /><br />
              On February 19th, at 4:00 AM, a gun was used to take my son from
              me. You know him as Pop Smoke, we called him 'Shar'. Because of
              gun violence, I'll never see my son run up the front of our steps,
              taking them two at a time; he won't ever take my hands again and
              dance with me; he won't come into my room and muscle pose in the
              mirror. Gun violence destroys families. It must stop. — Audrey
              Jackson during a "Gun Violence Destroys Families" public service
              announcement <br /><br />
              Danny Schwartz wrote in The Ringer that "Pop Smoke conquered New
              York rap and gave the city the kind of readymade and potentially
              defining star it hadn't seen in years". He claimed that "in New
              York City city, 'Welcome to the Party' was more omnipresent than
              hits like 'Old Town Road'. <br /><br />
              Jackson's work ethic was widely praised by his peers in the music
              industry. The executive producer of his posthumous album, 50 Cent,
              revealed Smoke was always "writing what said down" on his
              telephone, while Quavo added he "felt like he was talking to
              somebody that had been in the game for three years already".
              <br /><br />
              Producer Rico Beats stated that, in his last few months, Jackson
              started "telling kids, don't go the gang route", wanting to "be a
              better person". A few months after his death, his family announced
              the creation of Shoot for the Stars, a foundation Jackson had
              planned to create prior to his death, with the goal of helping and
              inspiring inner-city youth.After his death, several murals of him
              were created in Canarsie. Although his lyrics do not generally
              contend with police brutality or racism, his songs, particularly
              "Dior", were popularly used during the George Floyd protests in
              New York City as a symbol of resistance.

              <hr />
              The Meet the Woo Tour was scheduled to be the debut headlining
              concert tour by Pop Smoke. It was launched in support of his two
              mixtapes, Meet the Woo (2019) and Meet the Woo 2 (2020), and had
              been set to consist of concerts in North America and the United
              Kingdom. The tour was announced in January 2020, with dates being
              released at the same time. Pop Smoke later added more UK tour
              dates after high demand from fans. The tour was canceled after Pop
              Smoke was shot and killed. <br /><br />
              Tour dates were released on the same day for North America, while
              dates for the United Kingdom were revealed in February. Due to
              high demand from fans, more tour dates for the UK were revealed on
              February 13, 2020. Pop Smoke shared a promotional flyer for the
              tour on social media. Pop Smoke and his team were planning on
              finishing, mixing, and mastering his debut studio album Shoot for
              the Stars, Aim for the Moon, starting the first week of March
              2020.
              <br /><br />
              In an interview with Revolt, Pop Smoke's DJ Jeffrey Archer talked
              about the tour. "Honestly, it's nothing planned yet. We just got
              those dates. This is officially going to be our first real big
              tour. This is going to be a month. I’m very excited about it.
              We're going to a few places we've never been to. We've been
              getting feedback over the last seven months fans like, 'Please
              come out here.' There are loyal fans at these shows. You should
              expect a lot more music and shows. He has a lot of music coming
              out with a lot of artists. He’s not playing. We're definitely
              shaking the room in 2020."

              <span>Tour cancellation</span> <br /><br />
              The Meet the Woo Tour was later canceled after Pop Smoke was
              killed by a torso wound at the age of 20 in a home invasion on
              February 19, 2020. Four hooded men, including one wearing a ski
              mask and carrying a handgun, broke into a house he was renting in
              Hollywood Hills, California, and shot him twice in the chest. Fans
              were offered refunds after Pop Smoke's death: "As we mourn the
              loss of this great artist, refunds will be available at point of
              purchase."
