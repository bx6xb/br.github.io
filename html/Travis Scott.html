        <div class="text-header">Biography</div>
        <hr />
        Jacques Bermon Webster II, born April 30 1991, better known by his stage
        name Travis Scott (formerly stylized as Travi$ Scott), is an American
        rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. His stage name is the
        namesake of a favorite uncle combined with the first name of one of his
        inspirations, Kid Cudi (whose real name is Scott Mescudi). <br /><br />
        In 2012, Scott signed his first major-label contract with Epic Records
        and a publishing deal with Kanye West's GOOD Music. In April 2013, he
        signed a joint-recording contract with Epic and T.I.'s Grand Hustle
        imprint. Scott's first full-length project, the mixtape Owl Pharaoh, was
        self-released in 2013. It was followed with a second mixtape, Days
        Before Rodeo, in 2014. His debut studio album, Rodeo (2015), was led by
        the hit single "Antidote". His second album, Birds in the Trap Sing
        McKnight (2016), became his first number one album on the Billboard 200.
        The following year, Scott released a collaborative album with Quavo
        titled Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho under the group name Huncho Jack.
        <br /><br />
        In 2018, his third studio album, Astroworld, was released to critical
        acclaim and produced his first Billboard Hot 100 number one single,
        "Sicko Mode" (featuring Drake). In late 2019, Scott's record label
        Cactus Jack Records released the compilation album JackBoys, which
        topped the Billboard 200. After the release of his single "Franchise"
        (featuring Young Thug and M.I.A.) in 2020, Scott became the first artist
        on the Hot 100 to have three songs debut at number one in less than a
        year. <br /><br />
        Over the course of his career, Scott has become a globally recognized
        artist and pop culture figure. Along with his highly publicized
        relationship with American media personality Kylie Jenner, Scott has
        collaborated with organizations including Nike, Dior, and McDonald's. In
        2017, he founded the record label Cactus Jack Records. Throughout his
        career, Scott has achieved four number-one hits on the Billboard Hot
        100, along with 80 total charted songs. Additionally, he has been
        nominated for eight Grammy Awards and won a Billboard Music Award, Latin
        Grammy Award, MTV Video Music Award, and multiple BET Hip Hop Awards.
        <br /><br />
        Scott has also gained notoriety for controversies and legal issues
        regarding safety at his concerts. In November 2021, a mass-casualty
        crowd crush occurred during Scott's performance at the Astroworld
        Festival in his hometown of Houston, Texas, resulting in widespread
        condemnation of the artist.
        <div class="text-header">Early life</div>
        <hr />
        Jacques Bermon Webster II was born on April 30, 1991, in Houston, Texas.
        From ages one through six, Webster lived with his grandmother in South
        Park, Houston. Located in south-central Houston, the neighborhood was
        notorious for crime and had an impact on a young Webster, "Growing up,
        my grandmother stayed in the 'hood so I seen random crazy shit. mad bums
        and crazy spazzed out motherfuckers, I saw people looking weird, hungry,
        and grimey. I was always like, 'I gotta get the fuck out this shit.' It
        gave me my edge— who I am right now." Webster moved to Missouri City, a
        middle-class suburban area bordering southwest Houston, to live with his
        parents. His mother worked for Apple and his father ran his own
        business. Webster's father is also a soul musician and his grandfather
        was a jazz composer. Webster attended Elkins High School and graduated
        at seventeen. During high school, he participated in musical theater.
        Webster then attended the University of Texas at San Antonio, before
        dropping out his second year to fully pursue his music career.
        <div class="text-header">Career</div>
        <hr />
        <span>2008–2012: Career beginnings and record deals</span><br /><br />
        Webster formed a duo with his longtime friend Chris Holloway known as
        The Graduates. In 2008, the duo released their untitled first EP on
        social networking website Myspace. <br /><br />
        The following year, Scott and OG Chess, one of Scott's schoolmates,
        formed the group The Classmates. The Classmates released two projects,
        with Buddy Rich in 2009 and Cruis'n USA in 2010. Scott mainly handled
        production work on both projects. The duo remained together until late
        2012, when personal conflicts and financial disputes led to the
        disbandment of the group. <br /><br />
        After leaving college, Scott moved from Houston to Washington Heights in
        New York City where Scott began working with friend Mike Waxx, who owned
        the music website Illroots. After moving to New York, Scott slept on the
        floor at his friend's house and spent most of his time at Just Blaze's
        studio. Eventually frustrated in New York and the lack of progression,
        Scott moved to Los Angeles, California, after only four months in the
        state. <br /><br />
        In Los Angeles, Webster was abandoned by his friend who had promised to
        help him by providing housing. His parents cut him off financially and
        he eventually was forced to relocate back to Houston, where his parents
        kicked him out of their home. Webster moved back to Los Angeles once
        again and began to sleep on the couch of a friend who studied at
        University of Southern California. Atlanta-based rapper and owner of
        Grand Hustle Records, T.I. would later hear one of Webster's
        productions, titled "Lights (Love Sick)". While in Los Angeles, T.I.'s
        representative contacted Webster, asking him to attend a studio for a
        meeting. During the meeting, T.I. freestyled over "Animal", one of
        Webster's productions. <br /><br />
        <span>2012–2014: Owl Pharaoh and Days Before Rodeo</span><br /><br />
        Scott's First solo full-length project is a mixtape Titled Owl Pharaoh,
        which was set to be released as a free download in 2012. However, the
        project was delayed, and was announced to be slated for a later release.
        The project was later re-created by Kanye West and Mike Dean, and was
        then again delayed for sample clearance issues. In promotion Scott would
        release the track, "Blocka La Flame", a remix of fellow GOOD Music
        label-mate Pusha T's single "Blocka" (which features production and
        vocals from Scott). The song was produced by Young Chop, with additional
        production by Scott himself, alongside Mike Dean. On March 22, 2013,
        Scott released the music video for a song titled "Quintana", set to
        appear on Owl Pharaoh. The mixtape's version of the song features guest
        vocals from fellow American rapper Wale, while the production was
        handled by Scott himself, alongside Sak Pase and Mike Dean. On March 27,
        XXL revealed that Scott was a member of their Freshman Class of 2013. On
        March 29, 2013, following his interview with British disc jockey, DJ
        Semtex, Scott premiered a snippet of his commercial debut single, titled
        "Upper Echelon", featuring 2 Chainz and T.I. On April 2, 2013, Scott
        stated Owl Pharaoh was his official debut mixtape and would be released
        on the iTunes Store on May 21, 2013. On April 23, 2013, "Upper Echelon"
        was sent to urban contemporary radio. The EP was released for free
        download. <br /><br />
        On March 13, 2014, Scott performed a new song, tentatively titled "1975"
        featuring Big Sean, from his upcoming project at the time, at the Texan
        music festival South by Southwest (SXSW). Scott later confirmed via his
        Twitter account that the song is not called "1975", and would be
        included on his second mixtape, titled Days Before Rodeo. He would later
        take to his Twitter account to announce Rodeo, as the official title for
        his major-label debut studio album. On May 5, 2014, Scott released the
        full version of the song, with its new title "Don't Play", featuring a
        sample of the song "M.O.N.E.Y" by the English rock band the 1975. On
        July 11, 2014, "Don't Play" was officially released as the lead single
        from Days Before Rodeo, via digital distribution. <br /><br />
        Following the success of Days Before Rodeo, Scott announced that he
        would headline a concert tour, called The Rodeo Tour, with rapper Young
        Thug and producer Metro Boomin. The tour started on March 1, 2015, in
        Santa Ana, California, and ended on April 1, 2015, in Portland, Oregon.
        The tour ran through major cities such as Denver, Colorado, Houston,
        Texas, Chicago, Illinois, Detroit, Michigan, New York City, Atlanta,
        Georgia, Philadelphia, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, California
        and Seattle, Washington. Second shows were added to some cities such as
        Los Angeles and New York City, after his first shows sold out. Artists
        such as Kanye West, Chris Brown, Wale and Birdman made special guest
        appearances in certain cities. <br /><br />

        highest-charting single on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at
        number 16. Rodeo received generally positive reviews from critics and
        debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 chart. It also debuted
        at number one on the Billboard Rap Albums chart. <br /><br />
        On January 4, 2016, Scott would announce that he has a new studio album
        on the way. On February 8, 2016, it was announced that iLoveMakonnen,
        Vic Mensa and Scott would be a part of the "WANGSQUAD", an Alexander
        Wang campaign. On March 29, 2016, 300 Entertainment executive Lyor
        Cohen, revealed that Scott and Young Thug were releasing a single
        together and called Scott's upcoming album a "classic". On April 7,
        2016, Scott previewed a single with Young Thug at one of his shows. On
        May 17, 2016, Scott announced that the title of his second album would
        be Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, while also confirming the title for
        his third album to be Astroworld. On June 3, 2016, the collaborative
        single between Thug and Scott was released, titled "Pick Up the Phone".
        The single, which also features vocals from Quavo of Atlanta-based rap
        trio Migos, reached number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified
        double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
        <br /><br />
        On August 31, 2016, Scott announced that Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight
        was finally finished in a post on Instagram. Scott premiered the album
        on his third episode of .wav radio on September 2, 2016, and was later
        released on iTunes and Apple Music. On September 11, 2016, the album
        became Scott's first number one album on the US Billboard 200. On
        September 12, 2016, Universal Music Publishing Group's CEO, Jody Gerson
        announced that the label signed a worldwide deal with Scott.
        <br /><br />
        In the same episode Scott premiered Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, he
        also announced that he would be executive producing on Kanye West's
        Cruel Winter, a follow up to his G.O.O.D. Music label's debut
        compilation Cruel Summer. In the episode he described the upcoming album
        as, "very youthful, straight to the point, like the illest ever, man,
        like the illest album". <br /><br />

        ><br /><br />
        Scott performed at All-Star Weekend on February 16, 2017, in New
        Orleans, Louisiana at Champion Square. He also performed at New Orleans
        BUKU Music + Art Project festival on March 10, 2017. On March 5, Scott
        announced a concert tour called "Birds Eye View". The next day, the
        dates and cities for the tour were unveiled, with it beginning on March
        10, in New Orleans, Louisiana, and coming to an end on June 2, in
        Eugene, Oregon. In the same month, Scott was also featured alongside
        American rapper Quavo from the hip-hop group Migos on Canadian rapper
        Drake's single "Portland", from Drake's commercial mixtape, More Life.
        The song peaked at number nine on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming his
        first top ten song as a featured artist. In March 2017, Scott announced
        he would be launching his own imprint, under the name of Cactus Jack
        Records. During an interview, Scott said, "I'm not doing it to have
        financial control over my music. I want first and foremost to help other
        artists, launch new names, to provide opportunities. I want to do for
        them what happened to me, but better. By better I mean no bullshit. No
        lying to the artists about album release dates or the budgets of videos
        and albums." On June 15, 2017, Scott announced he would be doing a
        European leg of the "Birds Eye View Tour". The European leg started on
        the June 23 in Paris, and concluded on July 9 in Turku, Finland. This
        leg was mainly festival sets or in smaller club settings. <br /><br />
        On April 3, 2017, it was reported Scott had been working on a
        collaborative studio album with Quavo, potentially to be released later
        in 2017. Speaking to GQ, he confirmed: 'The Quavo album is coming soon.
        I'm dropping new music soon. You know how I do it though: I like
        surprises. In addition to the collaborative album, Scott announced his
        third studio album Astroworld, named after the defunct Houston theme
        park of the same name, was nearing completion and would most likely be
        released in 2017. <br /><br />
        On May 16, 2017, Scott released three new tracks on SoundCloud, after
        teasing on social media for some time. The tracks were named "A Man",
        "Green & Purple (featuring Playboi Carti)", and "Butterfly Effect". The
        latter was also released on every other streaming service, as the only
        track. The music video for "Butterfly Effect" was released on July 14,
        2017. On August 10, 2017, Scott tweeted "ALBUM MODE" as he had just
        finished the "DAMN. Tour" as a supporting act for Kendrick Lamar, the
        night before. This tweet signified that he was now working on his album
        AstroWorld full-time. On August 27, 2017, Scott performed with Thirty
        Seconds to Mars at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards on their single "Walk
        On Water". <br /><br />
        On September 18, 2017, Quavo and Migos did an interview, in which Quavo
        stated that his album with Scott was coming "real soon". He also stated
        that he and Scott had over 20 records ready. In October 2017, Scott was
        featured in a special piece titled "Deserve", by Chinese born Canadian
        rapper Kris Wu. On December 7, 2017, a clip of Quavo being interviewed
        by Zane Lowe was posted on the official Twitter account for Beats 1.
        When asked about the title of their upcoming project, he confirmed it
        would be Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho. <br /><br />
        On December 6, 2017, Scott was featured on fellow American rapper and
        singer Trippie Redd's single "Dark Knight Dummo", the lead single from
        the latter's debut studio album, Life's a Trip. The song peaked at 72 on
        the Billboard Hot 100. On December 21, 2017, Scott and Quavo released
        their collaborative studio album, Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho, under the
        name "Huncho Jack", a name which comes from Quavo's nickname "Huncho"
        and a play on Scott's first name "Jack". The album debuted at number 3
        on the Billboard 200 and had seven tracks chart on the Billboard Hot
        100. After the release of Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho, Webster was spotted
        in the studio a lot more frequently and Billboard slated an expected
        first quarter release for AstroWorld. <br /><br />
        On May 4, 2018, four days after his 27th birthday, Scott released a
        single titled "Watch" featuring American rappers Lil Uzi Vert and Kanye
        West. The single was released as promotional material for his third
        studio album Astroworld. Astroworld was released on August 3, 2018, to
        critical acclaim, and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. "Sicko
        Mode", the album's second single, peaked at number one on the Billboard
        Hot 100, becoming Scott's highest charting solo single. On the same
        month of the album's launch, Scott announced that he was going to launch
        Astroworld Festival, a music festival with the same name as the album.
        The festival took place on November 17. On November 2, 2018, Scott was
        featured on five tracks of Metro Boomin's debut studio album, Not All
        Heroes Wear Capes: "Overdue", "Dreamcatcher" (alongside Swae Lee), "Up
        to Something" (alongside Young Thug), "Only 1 (Interlude)", and "No
        More" (alongside Kodak Black and 21 Savage). In December, Billboard
        reported that Scott was to make a guest appearance at the Super Bowl
        LIII halftime show during Maroon 5's set. This performance was met with
        major backlash. <br /><br />

        On April 18, 2019, Scott released a single with SZA and The Weeknd for
        the popular HBO series Game of Thrones. It is titled "Power is Power"
        and is a reference to a scene that took place in the first episode of
        the show's second season The track is the second song on the Game of

        Fly, was released on Netflix. On October 4, 2019, Scott released a
        single, "Highest in the Room", which debuted and peaked at number one on
        the Hot 100, being his first song to debut at the top and his second
        number one following "Sicko Mode" in 2018. The same month, Scott was
        also featured on the remix of Young Thug's single, "Hot" with Gunna, who
        was featured on the original song as well. The song was later added to
        the deluxe edition of So Much Fun in December of that year. Scott also
        was featured on the track "Hop Off a Jet" from the deluxe edition.
        <br /><br />
        On December 2, 2019, Scott announced a compilation album with his Cactus
        Jack label members, consisting of Don Toliver, Sheck Wes and producer
        Chase B, titled JackBoys. On December 24, Scott revealed the album's
        release date via Instagram. The album was released on December 27, 2019,
        and featured a remix of "Highest in the Room" featuring Spanish singer
        Rosalía and American rapper Lil Baby, the latter's verse being leaked
        months prior. On the same day, Scott released the music video for "Gang
        Gang" performed by Wes, with uncredited vocals and cameo appearances
        from Scott, Toliver, and rapper Luxury Tax 50. On December 30, 2019,
        Scott released the music video for "Gatti", performed with the now-late

        ex-girlfriend Kylie Jenner. On March 20, 2020, Scott released the music
        video for "Out West", performed featuring Young Thug. <br /><br />
        Scott performed five virtual live shows in the video game Fortnite
        Battle Royale from April 23 to 25, 2020 with visuals based on his
        Astroworld tour. It received more than 27 million viewers and boosted
        the sales of Fortnite-branded Cactus Jack products such as action
        figures. The performance also included the premiere of his new song with
        Kid Cudi, who released the song, "The Scotts", as a duo under the same
        name. Tying with the performance, numerous cosmetic items for player
        avatars based on Scott and the concert were available to purchase by
        players of Fortnite Battle Royale. The song debuted at number-one on the
        Billboard Hot 100, becoming Scott's third US number-one. In May he
        collaborated for a second time with Rosalía on her track "TKN", where he
        raps in Spanish for the first time. Scott was on the cover of GQ's
        September 2020 issue, and revealed he will be releasing a collaborative
        album with Kid Cudi. This follows their number-one single, "The Scotts",
        released earlier in May. <br /><br />
        On the second anniversary of his third studio album Astroworld, Scott
        teased he was working on a new project. On August 22, 2020, Scott
        released the single "The Plan", the theme song to Christopher Nolan's
        film Tenet. He released the single "Franchise" featuring rappers Young
        Thug and M.I.A. on September 25, 2020. The song was previously previewed
        on Scott and Chase B's WAV radio, titled "White Tee". It debuted at
        number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and Scott became the first
        artist in Billboard chart history to have three songs debut at number
        one in less than a year. A remix with an additional feature from
        American rapper Future, was released on October 7, 2020. <br /><br />
        <span>2021–present: Return to performing and Utopia</span><br /><br />
        From mid to late-2020, Scott began teasing his fourth studio album
        Utopia. On January 15, 2021, Scott released a remix of "Goosebumps" with
        producer HVME. After canceling the third annual Astroworld Fest due to
        the COVID-19 pandemic, Scott announced the return of the festival in
        2021 and expanded it to a multi day format. On April 30, Scott was
        featured on "Durag Activity" by Baby Keem. In June, Scott announced a
        collaboration between Dior and Cactus Jack for the 2022 Summer Men's
        collection. On August 28, Scott was featured on Kanye West's tenth
        studio album Donda on the song "Praise God" also with Baby Keem, whom
        Scott had previously collaborated with. On September 3, Scott appeared
        on Drake's Certified Lover Boy, on the song "Fair Trade", which peaked
        in the top 10 of the Hot 100 at number three. On October 8, Don Toliver
        released an album Life of a Don, which featured Scott on songs titled
        "Flocky Flocky" and "You". <br /><br />
        On October 30, 2021, Travis Scott closed out day 3 of Rolling Loud NYC.
        During the set he performed the unreleased song "Escape Plan" and a
        preview of another unreleased track off Utopia. In November 2021, he
        announced new music to be released on November 5, 2021; he was believed
        to release a project reportedly titled Dystopia, but instead he released
        a two-song single "ESCAPE PLAN / MAFIA". <br /><br />
        On April 22, 2022, Scott was featured on his first song since the
        Astroworld Festival crowd crush, "Hold That Heat" alongside Future and
        producer Southside. On April 27, 2022, the Primavera Sound festival
        announced that Scott is scheduled to perform at their festivals held in
        Buenos Aires, Santiago, and São Paulo respectively. On May 15, 2022, he
        performed at the 2022 Billboard Music Awards. This performance was his
        first since the Astroworld Festival tragedy in 2021. On August 6, 2022,
        Scott performed his first solo show since the Astroworld Festival
        tragedy at The O2 Arena in London. That month, it was also announced
        that Scott would begin a Las Vegas nightclub residency titled "Road to
        Utopia" in September.
        <div class="text-header">Other ventures</div>
        <hr />
        <span>Cactus Jack Records</span><br /><br />
        Cactus Jack Records is an American record label founded by Scott in
        2017. It is distributed by Epic Records. The label also has its own
        publishing division Cactus Jack Publishing. <br /><br />
        During an interview regarding the label, Scott said: "I want first and
        foremost to help other artists, launch new names, to provide
        opportunities. I want to do for them what happened to me, but better. By
        better I mean no bullshit. No lying to the artists about album release
        dates or the budgets of videos and albums."<br /><br />
        <span>Astroworld Festival</span><br /><br />
        Following the release of Astroworld, Scott announced the Astroworld
        Festival, an annual festive concert that would take place across the
        street from the former site of Six Flags AstroWorld. The 2018 Astroworld
        Festival contained appearances from Post Malone, Lil Wayne, Young Thug,
        Rae Sremmurd, Gunna, Houston All Stars, Sheck Wes, Metro Boomin, Trippie
        Redd, Smokepurpp, Virgil Abloh, and Tommy Genesis. <br /><br />
        The 2019 festival contained appearances from Gucci Mane, Migos, Rosalía,
        Tay Keith, Pop Smoke, Young Thug, Young Dolph, Key Glock, Pharrell
        Williams, Sheck Wes, Marilyn Manson, DaBaby, Megan Thee Stallion, Don
        Toliver, Playboi Carti, and Houston All Stars. <br /><br />
        The 2020 festival was cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
        <br /><br />
        On November 5, the first night of the 2021 Astroworld Festival, a fatal
        crowd crush occurred. Ten people died from compressive asphyxiation,
        twenty-five people were hospitalised, and more than 300 people were
        treated for injuries. <br /><br />
        <span>Fashion</span><br /><br />
        On April 30, 2019, Scott announced a collaboration with Nike to release
        his Cactus Jack Air Jordan 1's in May that year. <br /><br />
        On June 24, 2021, Scott announced a collaboration with Dior for a
        menswear collection that is scheduled to be released in the summer of
        2021. A live stream showcasing the collection was released on June 25.
        The live stream also showcased snippets of songs from his upcoming
        fourth studio album Utopia featuring a song with Westside Gunn and
        instrumentals from the album. <br /><br />
        <span>McDonald's</span> <br /><br />
        In September 2020, Scott collaborated with McDonald's to launch a
        limited edition meal that was introduced in participating McDonald's
        restaurants in North America, named "The Travis Scott" and a variation
        on their Quarter Pounder with Cheese. The partnership marked the first
        nationally distributed celebrity-endorsed McDonald's meal in the chain’s
        history, and the first celebrity meal since 1992, when McDonald's
        launched a “McJordan” burger with Michael Jordan in the Chicago
        metropolitan area. Due to high demand, some McDonald's branches ran out
        of ingredients tied to the promotion, causing a break in the supply
        chain. Scott and McDonald's also launched a line of McDonald's and
        Cactus Jack–branded merchandise, including a number of clothing items, a
        rug, and a McNugget-shaped body pillow. This popularized the celebrity
        meal craze, which would later be done similarly by BTS and Saweetie. The
        idea was exported to Europe in the fall of 2021, with Spanish singer
        Aitana serving as the first European act to have its own McDonald's
        meal. <br /><br />
        <span>PlayStation</span><br /><br />
        In October 2020, Scott announced he was joining the PlayStation team as
        a Strategic Creative Partner to promote the PlayStation 5 console.
        Together, they released special merchandise, which includes a previously
        unseen version of Nike Dunk Lows. They also uploaded a special unboxing
        video of the PlayStation 5 console to YouTube. The video features
        footage of Scott playing the console alongside fans, a piano performance
        by James Blake, and a tribute to Pop Smoke. <br /><br />
        <span>The Scotts</span><br /><br />
        Aside from his solo musical career, Scott is also one-half of the
        alternative hip hop super-duo the Scotts, alongside his mentor and
        frequent collaborator, American musician Kid Cudi. They have currently
        been working on their debut collaborative effort since 2020, when the
        duo released the Billboard Hot 100 number one single, "The Scotts". In
        December 2022, Cudi revealed they were no longer working on the album,
        effectively announcing its cancellation. <br /><br />
        <span>Film industry</span><br /><br />
        Scott made his theatrical debut in the 2021 film Gully as a movie store
        owner. He also contributed to the film's soundtrack but his song "Knife"
        was cut due to sampling issues, but was still featured briefly in the
        film. On August 2, 2021, Scott signed a movie production deal with A24.
        The same day he announced the completion of a draft for a film based on
        his upcoming fourth studio album Utopia. <br /><br />
        <span>Cactus Jack Foundation</span><br /><br />
        Scott established the Cactus Jack Foundation in November 2020, to assist
        Houston youth with education expenses and creative endeavors. In
        December 2021, the foundation gave out thousands of toys to the children
        of Houston. On May 17, 2022, Scott announced that he would give away $1
        million in scholarships to 100 HBCU college students from the graduating
        class of 2022 through the Cactus Jack Foundation.
        <div class="text-header">Artistry</div>
        <hr />
        Scott has stated that Björk is "one of my biggest inspirations for why I
        do what I do". He is also influenced by Bon Iver, Kid Cudi, M.I.A.,
        Kanye West, Toro y Moi, Tame Impala, T.I., and Thom Yorke. Spin magazine
        compared his 2013 mixtape Owl Pharaoh to Kid Cudi's Man on the Moon II:
        The Legend of Mr. Rager. <br /><br />
        Scott makes heavy use of audio manipulation effects such as Auto-Tune,
        phasing, delays, and stereo-sculpted chorusing and harmony structures,
        predominantly influenced by producers Mike Dean and Alex Tumay. Scott's
        musical style has been characterized as "ambient"; Scott himself has
        said "I'm not hip-hop". Vulture described Scott's sound as
        "unremittingly dark, syncretic, hi-res, and above all unnatural".
        Scott’s musical style has been described as being hip hop, Southern hip
        hop, trap, psychedelic, and pop rap. <br /><br />
        Scott has said that he is a fan of Broadway theatre and would like to do
        an album of show tune covers. He has said that he would like to write
        his own musical in the future.
        <div class="text-header">Personal life</div>
        <hr />
        Scott began dating media personality and businesswoman Kylie Jenner in
        April 2017. In February 2018, Jenner gave birth to their daughter.
        Jenner appeared in the music video for "Stop Trying to Be God", from
        Scott's third studio album Astroworld. They broke up in September 2019,
        but quarantined together during the COVID-19 pandemic for the sake of
        their daughter and ended up rekindling their relationship. On September
        7, 2021, after weeks of speculation, Jenner revealed that she and Scott
        were expecting their second child. Jenner gave birth to their son in
        February 2022.
        <div class="text-header">Controversies and legal issues</div>
        <hr />
        <span>Incidents at performances</span><br /><br />
        Scott's performances have experienced a number of issues. At
        Lollapalooza in 2015, Scott was charged and arrested for disorderly
        conduct after inciting concertgoers to ignore security and rush the
        stage. That same year, at the Openair Festival in Switzerland, he
        encouraged fans to attack a man who took his shoe while he was
        crowd-surfing, by stopping the concert and repeatedly telling the crowd
        to "fuck him up", while also spitting on him. <br /><br />
        In 2017, he was arrested for similar conduct to his Lollapalooza
        behavior after a performance in Northwest Arkansas. That same year, a
        fan sued Scott and the organizers of a 2017 concert at Terminal 5 in
        Manhattan after falling from a balcony and being dragged on stage,
        blaming the fall on a crowd surge. In 2019, three people were trampled
        and injured as a crowd rushed to enter the compound at Astroworld.
        <br /><br />
        <span>Astroworld Festival crowd crush</span><br /><br />
        On November 5, 2021, at least ten people died and hundreds were injured
        in a crowd crush moving toward the stage during Scott's performance at
        the Astroworld Festival in NRG Park in his hometown of Houston, Texas.
        On the first night, a crowd crush occurred, resulting in the deaths of
        at least nine people and the cancellation of the second night of the
        festival. In video footage of the incident, Scott is seen doing the
        following: continuing to perform despite chants from the crowd pleading
        for him to stop; observing at least one audience member had been hurt,
        then ordering security for a brief moment to "help, jump in real quick,
        keep going", only to continue with the rest of the show for the
        following hour; encouraging people to "get wild" and "crazy", despite an
        ambulance passing through the crowd that was pulling out lifeless
        bodies. Victims killed ranged from 9 to 27 years old. <br /><br />
        In the aftermath of the crush, news outlets highlighted Scott's history
        of dangerous disregard for audience safety. Rolling Stone featured a
        statement from a fan who had been paralyzed during a 2017 show; The New
        York Times took note of Scott's 2015 guilty plea for reckless
        endangerment after he encouraged fans to climb security barricades; a
        Los Angeles Times article contained analysis by safety experts arguing
        that the deaths were preventable. Among other points of criticism was
        the fact that Scott halted his performance in 2015, when an audience
        member stole his shoe, ordering the crowd to beat up the person
        responsible. Shortly after, a lawsuit was announced by the concertgoers.
        It was started by Kristian Paredes, who filed for $1,000,000 due to the
        injuries he received. <br /><br />
        <span>Nebula assault allegations</span><br /><br />
        On March 1, 2023, Scott was performing at Nebula, a nightclub in New
        York City, alongside Don Toliver when a sound technician, identified
        only as Mark, asked Scott to lower the music as it was too loud for the
        venue's size. Scott reportedly responded by giving Mark the finger and
        punched him in the head, resulting in Mark needing medical attention and
        police being called to the scene around 3:25 a.m. Scott had reportedly
        been drinking alcohol and damaged $12,000 in the club's sound equipment
        before he left the premises. The New York City Police Department issued
        a warrant for Scott's arrest in relation to the incident on March 2,
        2023.
