              <hr />
              Aubrey Drake Graham, born October 24 1986, is a Canadian rapper,
              singer and actor. An influential figure in contemporary popular
              music, Drake has been credited for popularizing singing and R&B
              sensibilities in hip hop. Gaining recognition by starring as Jimmy
              Brooks in the CTV teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation
              (2001–2008), Drake pursued a career in music releasing his debut
              mixtape Room for Improvement in 2006. He followed this with the
              mixtapes Comeback Season (2007) and So Far Gone (2009) before
              signing with Young Money Entertainment.
              <br /><br />
              Drake's first three albums, Thank Me Later (2010), Take Care
              (2011) and Nothing Was the Same (2013), were all critical
              successes and propelled him to the forefront of hip hop. His
              fourth album, Views (2016), saw exploration of dancehall and stood
              atop the Billboard 200 for 13 non-consecutive weeks, making it the
              first album by a male artist to do so in over a decade, and
              featured the chart record-setting lead single "One Dance". In
              2018, Drake released the double album Scorpion, which contained
              the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "God's Plan", "Nice for
              What", and "In My Feelings". Drake's widely anticipated sixth
              album, Certified Lover Boy (2021), achieved nine top 10 hits on
              the Hot 100, setting the then-record for most US top-ten hits from
              one album, with its lead single "Way 2 Sexy" reaching number one.
              In 2022, Drake released the house-inspired album Honestly,
              Nevermind and the collaborative album, Her Loss, with 21 Savage.
              Known for frequent accompanying releases to his albums, Drake
              achieved critical and commercial success with the mixtapes If
              You're Reading This It's Too Late (2015) and More Life (2017).
              <br /><br />
              As an entrepreneur, Drake founded the OVO Sound record label with
              longtime collaborator 40 in 2012. In 2013, Drake became the
              "global ambassador" of the Toronto Raptors, joining their
              executive committee and later obtaining naming rights to their
              practice facility. In 2016, he began collaborating with Brent
              Hocking on the bourbon whiskey Virginia Black. Drake heads the OVO
              fashion label and the Nocta collaboration with Nike, and founded
              the production company DreamCrew and the fragrance house Better
              World. In 2018, Drake was reportedly responsible for 5 percent
              (CAD$440 million) of Toronto's CAD$8.8 billion annual tourism
              income. In 2022, he became a part owner of Italian football club
              A.C. Milan. <br /><br />
              Among the world's best-selling music artists, with over 170
              million records sold, Drake is ranked as the highest-certified
              digital singles artist in the United States by the RIAA. He has
              won five Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, a record 34
              Billboard Music Awards, two Brit Awards, and three Juno Awards.
              Drake has achieved 11 number-one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 and
              holds further Hot 100 records; he has the most top 10 singles
              (67), most charted songs (293), the most simultaneously charted
              songs in one week (27), the most Hot 100 debuts in one week (22),
              and the most continuous time on the Hot 100 (431 weeks). He
              additionally has the most number-one singles on the R&B/Hip-Hop
              Airplay, Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Hot Rap Songs, and Rhythmic
              Airplay charts.
              <div class="text-header">Early life</div>
              <hr />
              Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto,
              Ontario. His father, Dennis Graham, is an African-American
              Catholic drummer from Memphis who once performed with country
              musician Jerry Lee Lewis. His mother, Sandra "Sandi" Graham (née
              Sher), is a Canadian Ashkenazi Jew, who worked as an English
              teacher and florist. Graham performed at Club Bluenote in Toronto,
              where he met Sandra, who was in attendance. Drake is a dual
              citizen of the U.S. and Canada, the former derived from Graham. In
              his youth, he attended a Jewish day school and had a bar mitzvah.
              <br /><br />
              Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old. After the
              divorce, he and his mother remained in Toronto; his father
              returned to Memphis, where he was incarcerated for a number of
              years on drug-related charges. Graham's limited finances and legal
              issues caused him to remain in the U.S. until Drake's early
              adulthood. Prior to his arrest, Graham would travel to Toronto and
              bring Drake to Memphis every summer. His father later collaborated
              with Canadian music group Arkells on the music video for a song
              titled "Drake's Dad". Graham claimed in an interview that Drake's
              assertions of him being an absent father were embellishments used
              to sell music, which Drake vehemently denies. <br /><br />
              Drake was raised in two neighbourhoods. He lived on Weston Road in
              Toronto's working-class west end until grade six and attended
              Weston Memorial Junior Public School until grade four, playing
              minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. Drake was a promising
              right winger, reaching the Upper Canada College hockey camp, but
              left at the behest of his mother following a vicious cross-check
              to his neck during a game by an opposing player. He then moved to
              one of the city's affluent neighbourhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000.
              When asked about the move, Drake replied, "We had a half of a
              house we could live in. The other people had the top half, we had
              the bottom half. I lived in the basement, my mom lived on the
              first floor. It was not big, it was not luxurious. It was what we
              could afford." Demonstrating an affinity for the arts, at age 10,
              Drake appeared in a comedic sketch which aired during the 1997 NHL
              Awards, featuring a riff of Martin Brodeur and Ron Hextall and
              their record as being the only goalies to have scored multiple
              goals.
              <br /><br />
              He attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute for high school, and
              then attended Vaughan Road Academy in Toronto's multicultural
              Oakwood–Vaughan neighbourhood; Drake described Vaughan Road
              Academy as "not by any means the easiest school to go to." During
              his teenage years, Drake worked at a now-closed Toronto furniture
              factory owned by his maternal grandfather, Reuben Sher. Drake said
              he was bullied at school for his racial and religious background,
              and upon determining that his class schedule was detrimental to
              his burgeoning acting career, he dropped out of school. Drake
              later graduated in October 2012.

              <span>2001–2009: Career beginnings</span><br /><br />
              At the age of 15, Drake, eager to begin his career as an actor,
              was introduced to a high school friend's father, an acting agent.
              The agent found Drake a role on the Canadian teen drama series
              Degrassi: The Next Generation. Drake portrayed Jimmy Brooks, a
              basketball star who became physically disabled after he was shot
              by a classmate. Drake reportedly disliked this character arc
              because of its apparent tokenism (his was one of the only black
              characters in the series), and he also believed it could
              negatively influence his standing as a rapper. Longtime series
              writer James Hurst said that Drake threatened legal action to redo
              the storyline, before ultimately agreeing to it. Madeleine
              Robinson, the executive director of the Californian non-profit
              organization Wheelchair 4 Kids, praised the storyline and Drake's
              performance, noting "he instilled confidence and representation"
              to disabled youth. When asked about his early acting career, Drake
              replied, "My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke.
              The only money I had coming in was from Canadian TV." He appeared
              in a total of 100 episodes between 2001 and 2008. In 2010, Drake
              expressed interest in playing Barack Obama in a biopic, to which
              Obama responded with approval in an interview in 2020.
              <br /><br />
              According to Degrassi series creators Stephen Stohn and Linda
              Schuyler, Drake regularly arrived late on set after spending
              nights recording music. To prevent this, Schuyler claimed Drake
              struck an agreement with the set's security guards to gain entry
              to the set after recording to be allowed to sleep in a dressing
              room. <br /><br />
              Being musically inspired by Jay-Z and Clipse, Drake self-released
              his debut mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006. The mixtape
              featured Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco and included vast production
              from Boi-1da and Frank Dukes. When asked about the mixtape, Drake
              described the project as "pretty straightforward, radio friendly,
              and not much content to it." Room for Improvement was released for
              sale only and sold roughly 6,000 copies, for which Drake received
              $304.04 in royalties. He performed his first concert on August 19,
              2006, at the Kool Haus nightclub as an opening act for Ice Cube,
              performing for half an hour and earning $100. In 2007, Drake
              released his second mixtape Comeback Season. Released from his
              recently founded October's Very Own label, it spawned the single
              "Replacement Girl" featuring Trey Songz. The song made Drake
              become the first unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video
              on BET, with "Replacement Girl" featured on their "New Joint of
              the Day" segment in April 2007. The song also saw Drake sample
              "Man of the Year" by Brisco, Flo Rida and Lil Wayne, retaining Lil
              Wayne's verse, and adjoined his own to the song's earlier half.
              This caused Jas Prince to gift Lil Wayne the song, which prompted
              the rapper to invite Drake to Houston to join his Tha Carter III
              tour. Throughout the duration of the tour, Drake and Lil Wayne
              recorded multiple songs together, including "Ransom", "Forever",
              and a remix to "Brand New". <br /><br />
              In 2009, Drake released his third mixtape So Far Gone. It was made
              available for free download through his OVO blog website, and
              featured Lil Wayne, Trey Songz, Omarion, Lloyd, and Bun B. It
              received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release,
              finding mainstream commercial success from the singles "Best I
              Ever Had" and "Successful", both gaining Gold certification by the
              Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with the former
              also peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. This prompted
              the mixtape's re-release as an EP, featuring only four songs from
              the original, as well as the additions of the songs "I'm Goin' In"
              and "Fear". It debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and won
              the Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.
              <br /><br />
              Due to the success of the mixtape, Drake was the subject of a
              bidding war from various labels, often reported as "one of the
              biggest bidding wars ever". Despite this, Drake was rumoured to
              have secured a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment
              on June 29, 2009. This was later confirmed following a planned
              lawsuit from Young Money, in conjunction with Drake, against an
              unauthorized fake album titled The Girls Love Drake released on
              iTunes. <br /><br />
              Drake then joined the rest of the label's roster on the America's
              Most Wanted Tour in July 2009. However, during a performance of
              "Best I Ever Had" in Camden, New Jersey, Drake fell on stage and
              tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He
              underwent surgery later that year. <br /><br />

                >2010–2012: Musical breakthrough with Thank Me Later and Take
                Care</span
              ><br /><br />
              Drake planned to release his debut album, Thank Me Later, in late
              2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March
              2010, and then to May 25, 2010. Young Money and Universal Motown
              had then released a statement that the album had again been pushed
              back three weeks for a June 15, 2010, release. <br /><br />On
              March 9, 2010, Drake released the debut single "Over", which
              peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as
              topping the Rap Songs chart. It also received a nomination for
              Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards. His second
              single, "Find Your Love", became an even bigger success. It peaked
              at number five on the Hot 100, and was certified Platinum by the
              Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The music video
              for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica, and was criticized
              by Jamaica's minister of tourism Edmund Bartlett. Bartlett
              condemned the portrayal of the island in the video, saying, "care
              has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in
              showcasing images of our destination and people. Gun culture,
              while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing the island's image."
              The third single and fourth singles, "Miss Me" and "Fancy"
              respectively, attained moderate commercial success; however, the
              latter garnered Drake his second nomination at the 53rd Grammy
              Awards for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. On April 29, it
              was reportedly announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later
              during a show in Kansas City, Missouri. <br /><br />
              Thank Me Later was released on June 15, 2010, debuting at number
              one on the Billboard 200 with sales of over 447,000 copies in its
              first week. Upon the album's release, 25,000 fans gathered at New
              York City's South Street Seaport for a free concert hosted by
              Drake and Hanson, which was later cancelled by the police after a
              near-riot ensued due to overflowing crowds. The album became the
              top selling debut album for any artist in 2010, and featured Lil
              Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay Z.
              <br /><br />
              It was soon announced that Drake would have a prominent role in
              the military science fiction video game, Gears of War 3. He was
              scheduled to play the role of Jace Stratton, but scheduling
              conflicts with his upcoming Away from Home Tour prevented him from
              accepting the role. He began the tour on September 20, 2010, in
              Miami, Florida, performing at 78 shows over four different legs.
              It concluded in Las Vegas in November 2010. Due to the success of
              the Away from Home Tour, Drake hosted the first OVO Festival in
              2010. It would soon become a regular event during the summer, with
              the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto playing host to the festival on
              its annual cycle. Drake also had an eco-friendly college tour to
              support the album, beginning with Eastern Illinois University in
              Charleston, Illinois. It concluded in Plymouth, New Hampshire on
              May 8, and he also performed at The Bamboozle on May 1.
              <br /><br />
              Beginning his second effort in fall 2010, Drake announced his
              intentions to allow Noah "40" Shebib to handle most of the
              production and record a more cohesive sound than on Thank Me
              Later, which featured disparate production duties by Shebib and
              others. In November 2010, Drake revealed the title of his next
              studio album will be Take Care. In comparison to his debut album,
              Drake revealed to Y.C Radio 1 that Thank Me Later was a rushed
              album, stating, "I didn't get to take the time that I wanted to on
              that record. I rushed a lot of the songs and sonically I didn't
              get to sit with the record and say, 'I should change this verse.'
              Once it was done, it was done. That's why my new album is called
              Take Care, because I get to take my time this go-round." Drake
              sought to expand on the low-tempo, sensuous, and dark sonic
              esthetic of Thank Me Later. Primarily a hip hop album, Drake also
              attempted to incorporate R&B and pop to create a languid,
              grandiose sound. <br /><br />
              In January 2011, Drake was in negotiations to join Eva Green and
              Susan Sarandon as a member of the cast in Nicholas Jarecki's
              Arbitrage, before ultimately deciding against starring in the
              movie to focus on the album. "Dreams Money Can Buy" and "Marvins
              Room" were released on Drake's October's Very Own Blog, on May 20
              and June 9, respectively. Acting as promotional singles for Take
              Care, the former was eventually unincluded on the album's final
              track listing, while "Marvins Room" gained Gold certification by
              the RIAA, as well as peaking at number 21 on the Billboard Hot
              100, and reaching the top 10 of the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart,
              coupled with extensive play on contemporary urban radio. Drake
              would soon release the song's music video on June 28. <br /><br />
              "Headlines" was released on August 9 as the lead single for Take
              Care. It was met with positive critical and commercial response,
              reaching number thirteen on the Hot 100, as well as becoming his
              tenth single to reach the summit of the Billboard Hot Rap Songs,
              making Drake the artist with the most number-one singles on the
              chart, with 12. It was eventually certified Platinum in both the
              United States and Canada. The music video for the single was
              released on October 2, and foresaw Drake performing the song
              during the second intermission of the 59th National Hockey League
              All-Star Game in January 2012. "Make Me Proud" was released as the
              album's second single on October 16. It was the final single to be
              released prior to the launch of the album, and debuted at number
              97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song reached number nine the
              following week, tying the record for the largest jump on the
              Billboard Hot 100 for a male artist, with 88. "Make Me Proud" soon
              became Drake's fourth consecutive single to receive Platinum
              certification by the RIAA.
              <br /><br />
              Prior to the album's release, Drake planned to record a
              collaborative album with Lil Wayne; however, it was ultimately
              scrapped due to the success of Watch the Throne. He also began
              collaborations with Rick Ross for a mixtape titled Y.O.L.O., but
              the duo decided against the project in favor of increased concern
              for their respective studio albums. Although in 2021, Ross stated
              that a joint album is still possible as they've casually discussed
              it. <br /><br />
              Take Care was released on November 15, 2011, and received
              generally positive reviews from music critics.John McDonnell of
              NME dubbed it "an affecting masterpiece" and commended its
              "delicate, mellifluous sound and unashamedly candid, emotive
              lyrics."Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal found Drake's "technical
              abilities" to be improved and stated, "Just as his thematic
              concerns have become richer, so has the music backing them
              up."Andy Hutchins of The Village Voice called it "a carefully
              crafted bundle of contradictory sentiments from a conflicted
              rapper who explores his own neuroses in as compelling a manner as
              anyone not named Kanye West."Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot
              complimented the depth of Drake's "moral psychodramas" and stated,
              "the best of it affirms that Drake is shaping a pop persona with
              staying power."It also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at
              the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and achieved great commercial
              success, eventually being certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA
              in 2016, with sales for the album marking 2.6 million in the U.S.
              <br /><br />
              The album's third and fourth singles, "The Motto" and Take Care",
              were released on November 29, 2011 and February 21, 2012,
              respectively. Each song was subject to commercial success, while
              also having large societal impacts, with "The Motto" credited for
              popularizing the phrase "YOLO" in the United States. The music
              video for "Take Care" saw widespread acclaim, with MTV stating,
              "None of his contemporaries – not even the ever-obtuse Kanye West
              – make videos like this, mostly because no one else can get away
              with it."The video received four nominations at the 2012 MTV Video
              Music Awards for Best Male Video, Best Art Direction, Best
              Cinematography, and Video of the Year. The song was also featured
              on the channel's "Pop Songs You Must Hear" list of 2011. "HYFR"
              was the final single to be released from the album, and became
              certified Gold. It also won the MTV Video Music Award for Best
              Hip-Hop Video in 2012, and the channel ranked him number two on
              their "Hottest MCs in the Game" list. <br /><br />
              On August 5, 2012, Drake released "Enough Said", performed by
              American recording artist Aaliyah featuring additional vocals
              provided by himself. Originally recorded prior to the singer's
              death in a plane crash in 2001, Drake later finished the track
              with producer "40". "Enough Said" was released by Blackground
              Records through their SoundCloud account on August 5, 2012. It was
              sent to US urban and rhythmic radio stations on August 21. The
              song charted at number 55 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.
              <br /><br />
              In promotion of his second album, Drake embarked on the worldwide
              Club Paradise Tour. It became the most successful hip hop tour of
              2012, grossing over $42 million. He then returned to acting,
              starring in Ice Age: Continental Drift as Ethan. <br /><br />

                >2013–2015: Nothing Was the Same and If You're Reading This It's
                Too Late</span
              ><br /><br />
              During the European leg of the Club Paradise Tour, Drake spoke in
              an interview stating that he had begun working on his third studio
              album. Revealing his intentions to remain with 40 as the album's
              executive producer, Drake spoke fondly about Jamie xx, hoping to
              include and expand the British producer's influence over his next
              album. Drake had also revealed that the album would stylistically
              differ from Take Care, departing from the ambient production and
              despondent lyrics prevalent previously. <br /><br />
              In January 2013, Drake announced that he would release the first
              single off his third album at the end of the 55th Annual Grammy
              Awards. Despite an initial delay, it was released in the wake of
              his win for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the event, and
              it foresaw Drake announcing Nothing Was the Same as the title of
              his third album. The album's second single, "Hold On, We're Going
              Home", was released in August 2013, becoming the most successful
              single off the album, peaking at number one on the Billboard Hot
              R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Drake sought inspiration from the 1980s
              television series Miami Vice during the composition of the song's
              music video, incorporating the dramatic elements seen in the show
              en route to winning his second MTV Video Music Award in 2014 for
              the video. Drake appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon,
              performing the album's third single, "Too Much", alongside
              featured artist Sampha.
              <br /><br />
              Nothing Was the Same was released on September 24, 2013, debuting
              at number one on the US Billboard 200, with 658,000 copies sold in
              its first week of release. The album debuted atop the charts in
              Canada, Denmark, Australia and the United Kingdom. The album also
              enjoyed generally favourable reviews by contemporary music
              critics, commending the musical shift in terms of the tone and
              subject matter, comparing it to the distinct change showcased in
              Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak. The album was also reported to
              have sold over 1,720,000 copies in the United States, and was
              further promoted by the "Would You like a Tour?" throughout late
              2013 to early 2014. It became the 22nd-most successful tour of the
              year, grossing an estimated $46 million. Drake then returned to
              acting in January 2014, hosting Saturday Night Live, as well as
              serving as the musical guest. His versatility, acting ability and
              comedic timing were all praised by critics, describing it as what
              "kept him afloat during the tough and murky SNL waters". Drake
              also performed in Dubai, being one of the only artists ever to
              perform in the city. In late 2014, Drake announced that he began
              recording sessions for his fourth studio album. <br /><br />
              In 2014, Drake performed in Spanish as a featured artist on the
              Romeo Santos song "Odio". He also appeared on a remix of "Tuesday"
              by ILoveMakonnen, which peaked at number one on Billboard's
              Rhythmic chart and number twelve on the "Hot 100", and released "0
              to 100 / The Catch Up" as a non-album single. The latter went
              double platinum in the United States. <br /><br />
              On February 12, 2015, Drake released If You're Reading This It's
              Too Late onto iTunes with no prior announcement. Despite debate on
              whether it was an album or a mixtape, its commercial stance
              quantifies it as his fourth retail project with Cash Money
              Records, a scheme that was rumoured to allow Drake to leave the
              label. However, he eventually remained with Cash Money, and If
              You're Reading This It's Too Late sold over 1 million units in
              2015, making Drake the first artist with a platinum project in
              2015, as well as his fourth overall. <br /><br />

                >2015–2017: What a Time to Be Alive, Views, and More Life</span
              ><br /><br />
              On July 31, 2015, Drake released four singles: "Back to Back",
              "Charged Up", "Hotline Bling", and "Right Hand". On September 20,
              2015, Drake released a collaborative mixtape with Future, which
              was recorded in Atlanta in just under a week. What a Time to Be
              Alive debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Drake the
              first hip hop artist to have two projects reach number one in the
              same year since 2004. It was later certified platinum by the
              Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined
              sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of over 1 million
              units. Drake also appeared on the cover of The Fader for their
              100th issue. Drake announced in January 2016 that his fourth
              studio album would be launched during the spring, releasing the
              promotional single "Summer Sixteen" later that month. The album
              was originally titled Views from the 6, but was later shortened to
              Views. "Summer Sixteen" debuted at number six on the US Billboard
              Hot 100, and proved controversial, with Drake comparing his
              standing in hip hop to more tenured artists. This move divided
              many contemporary music critics, describing his self-comparison as
              "goodly brash" or "conventionally disrespectful."It was also
              interpreted as a diss track towards Tory Lanez, who was unhappy at
              Drake for popularizing the term "The Six" when referencing
              Toronto. <br /><br />
              Drake soon released the album's lead singles, "Pop Style" and the
              dancehall-infused "One Dance", on April 5. Both debuted within the
              top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100; however, the latter proved more
              commercially successful, with "One Dance" becoming Drake's first
              number-one single in Canada and the US as a leading artist. The
              single also became Drake's first number one single as a lead
              artist in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number one in Germany,
              France, Australia, Brazil, Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the
              Netherlands. During an episode for OVO Sound Radio, Drake
              confirmed the album's release date of April 29, and followed it up
              with various promotional videos. On October 15, "One Dance" became
              Spotify's most-streamed song ever, amassing over 882 million plays
              as of October 2016. <br /><br />
              Views was previewed in London before its premiere on Beats 1 a day
              later. It was released as an Apple Music and iTunes exclusive on
              April 29 before being made available to various other platforms
              later that week. Views would become Drake's most commercially
              successful album, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten
              nonconsecutive weeks, as well as simultaneously leading the
              Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 for eight weeks. It also
              achieved double-platinum status in the U.S., and earned over 1
              million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release,
              as well as gaining over half-billion overall streams of the album.
              Despite its success, critical opinion towards the album remained
              much divided, drawing criticism for being overlong and lacking in
              a cohesive theme, while also claiming Drake was not challenging
              himself artistically, as opposed to his contemporaries. He later
              released a short film titled Please Forgive Me, starring Swedish
              twin models Elizabeth and Victoria Lejonhjärta who are frequent
              collaborators with him. As of 2019, Views remains Drake's
              best-selling album in pure sales.
              <br /><br />
              Drake returned to host Saturday Night Live on May 14, serving as
              the show's musical guest. Later, Drake was named as a member of
              the Forbes Five, which ranks the wealthiest artists in hip-hop,
              placing fifth after Birdman, Jay Z, Dr. Dre, and Diddy
              respectively. Drake and Future then announced the Summer Sixteen
              Tour to showcase their collective mixtape, as well as their
              respective studio albums. This marked Drake's third co-headlining
              tour, which began in Austin, Texas on July 20. On July 23, Drake
              announced that he was working on a new project, scheduled to be
              released in early 2017, and was later named as the headline act
              for the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Festival. The latter dates of the
              Summer Sixteen Tour were postponed, however, due to Drake
              suffering an ankle injury. According to Pollstar, the Summer
              Sixteen Tour was revealed to be the highest grossing hip-hop tour
              of all time, with gross of $84.3 million across 56 dates between
              July and October 2016. This dethroned the previous record of $75.6
              million through 63 dates for the Watch the Throne Tour.
              <br /><br />
              During the 2016 OVO Festival, Kanye West confirmed that he and
              Drake had begun working on a collaborative album. Soon after, the
              music video for "Child's Play" was released, depicting Drake and
              Tyra Banks playing a couple encountering relationship issues at
              the Cheesecake Factory in a reference to one of the song's lyrics.
              On September 26, Please Forgive Me was released as an Apple Music
              exclusive. It ran a total of 25 minutes, and featured music from
              Views. At the 2016 BET Hip-Hop Awards, Drake received the most
              nominations, with 10, winning the awards for Album of the Year and
              Best Hip-Hop Video. Drake later announced the Boy Meets World Tour
              on October 10, with twenty-six dates announced for the course of
              the tour in Europe. Seven additional dates were added a day later
              due to overwhelming demand. <br /><br />
              Soon after, during an episode of OVO Sound Radio, Drake confirmed
              he would be releasing a project titled More Life in December.
              However, he later pushed the date back to the new year. The
              project was described as a "playlist of original music", rather
              than being classified as a traditional mixtape or solo album. He
              was later revealed to be Spotify's most streamed artist for the
              second consecutive year in 2016, amassing a total 4.7 billion
              streams for all projects on the service, which is more than double
              the amount of streams he had in 2015. Drake later secured his
              second and third Grammy Awards, winning for Best Rap/Sung
              Performance and Best Rap Song at the 59th ceremony. Despite
              multiple setbacks, Drake announced More Life would be released on
              March 18, 2017, via a series of multiple video commercials
              released through Instagram. Upon release, More Life received
              mostly positive reviews, and debuted atop the Billboard 200,
              earning 505,000 album-equivalent units in its first week. It also
              set a streaming record, becoming the highest ever streamed album
              in 24 hours, with a total of 89.9 million streams on Apple Music
              alone. The album also garnered 61.3 million streams on Spotify,
              dethroning Ed Sheeran's ÷ as the highest opening on the service in
              a single day. He later won 13 awards at the 2017 Billboard Music
              Awards in May, which saw him breaking the record for the most wins
              in a single show. Billboard also reported Drake had been present
              on the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive years, and has the most
              recorded entries by a solo artist. He later declined to submit
              More Life for consideration at the 2018 Grammy Awards, stemming
              from his displeasure at "Hotline Bling" being "pigeonholed" into
              the rap category.
              <br /><br />
              He then released the single "Signs" on June 24, as well as
              reuniting with Metro Boomin on a single with Offset. The singles
              marked his first releases since More Life, with "Signs" was
              initially released as a collaboration between Drake and French
              fashion house Louis Vuitton, as part of the "Louis Vuitton Men's
              Spring-Summer 2018" fashion show.
              <br /><br />
              Drake hosted the first annual NBA Awards on June 26, and starred
              in multiple commercials alongside his father in promotion of
              Virginia Black. Drake also appeared in The Carter Effect
              documentary, honouring the basketball career of Vince Carter, who
              was the first superstar player to play for the Toronto Raptors
              since the franchise's inception in 1995. The documentary also
              featured NBA players Chris Bosh, Tracy McGrady, Steve Nash, and
              LeBron James. <br /><br />

              After rumours circulated of Drake possibly collaborating with
              various artists, including rapper Trippie Redd and producer
              Pi'erre Bourne, for his new studio album, multiple snippets of
              songs were leaked near the closing end of 2017. Two songs would
              later be released as members of a mini EP, titled Scary Hours, on
              January 20, 2018, marking Drake's first solo release since More
              Life, as well as his first appearance on any song after featuring
              on a remix of the Jay-Z song "Family Feud" with Lil Wayne, as the
              lead single of the latter's Dedication 6: Reloaded mixtape. Scary
              Hours featured the songs "Diplomatic Immunity" and "God's Plan",
              which both debuted within the top-ten, with the latter eventually
              breaking various streaming records as it debuted at number one on
              the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was Drake's first song as a
              solo artist to reach number one, as well as his second chart
              topper as a lead artist.
              <br /><br />
              Drake earned his 70th top 40 entry after featuring on the Migos
              song "Walk It Talk It", which debuted at number eighteen, and
              peaked at number ten. He was later featured on BlocBoy JB's debut
              single "Look Alive", which was released on February 9, 2018. The
              song's entry at number six on the Hot 100 made Drake the rapper
              with the most top 10 hits on the Hot 100, with 23. He then
              featured on a remix to "Lemon", a song originally released as a
              collaboration between band N.E.R.D and Rihanna. On April 5, Drake
              announced he was finishing his fifth studio album and he was
              releasing a single later that night. On April 6, "Nice for What"
              was released, alongside a music video directed by Karena Evans,
              which featured several female celebrities. <br /><br />
              After "Nice For What" replaced his own "God's Plan" on the
              Billboard Hot 100 at number one, making him the first artist to
              have a new number-one debut replace their former number-one debut,
              Drake announced the title of his fifth studio album as Scorpion,
              with a planned release date of June 29, 2018. He then released
              "I'm Upset" on May 26 as the album's third single. Scorpion was
              then released as a double-album, and marked Drake's longest
              project, with a run-time of just under 90 minutes. The album broke
              both the one-day global records on Spotify and Apple Music, as it
              gained 132.45 million and 170 million plays on each streaming
              service, respectively. It eventually sold 749,000 album equivalent
              units in its first week of sales, and debuted at number one on the
              Billboard 200. In 2018, articles by The Guardian and Rolling Stone
              called him "the definitive pop star of his generation" and
              "perhaps the biggest post-Justin Timberlake male pop star of the
              new millennium", respectively. <br /><br />
              Shortly thereafter, Drake collaborated with British hip hop
              promotion Link Up TV on July 7, releasing a freestyle as a part of
              the promotion's 'Behind Barz' segment, before releasing another
              freestyle a week later after featuring on Charlie Sloth's
              long-running Fire in the Booth program on BBC Radio 1Xtra. Drake
              then earned his sixth number-one hit with "In My Feelings" on July
              21, which also spawned the viral "#InMyFeelingsChallenge" or
              "#KiKiChallenge". The success of "In My Feelings" also made Drake
              the record holder for most number one hits among rappers. Soon
              after, he released the music video for "Nonstop", which was filmed
              in London during his surprise performance at the Wireless
              Festival. <br /><br />
              He then appeared on the Travis Scott album Astroworld, featuring
              uncredited vocals for his song "Sicko Mode", which peaked at
              number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Drake announced in July 2018
              that he planned to "take 6 months to a year" to himself to return
              to television and films, producing the television series Euphoria
              and Top Boy. He then began the Aubrey & the Three Migos Tour with
              co-headliners Migos on August 12. This preceded a collaboration
              with Bad Bunny titled "Mia", which featured Drake performing in
              Spanish. He subsequently received the award for Hot Ticket
              Performer at the 2018 BET Hip Hop Awards on October 16. During a
              performance in Edmonton on November 7, Drake announced his
              intention to begin composing his next project in early 2019.
              <br /><br />
              In February 2019, he received his fourth Grammy Award for Best Rap
              Song, for "God's Plan", at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. During
              his speech, producers abruptly cut to a commercial break, leading
              viewers to speculate they were censoring his speech during which
              he criticized The Recording Academy. A legal representative for
              the academy then released a statement stating "a natural pause led
              the producers to assume that he was done and cut to commercial,"
              and added the organization offered him an opportunity to return to
              stage, but he declined. <br /><br />
              On February 14, Drake re-released his third mixtape, So Far Gone,
              onto streaming services for the first time to commemorate its
              10-year anniversary, and later collaborated with Summer Walker on
              a remix of Walker's song "Girls Need Love", marking his first
              release of 2019. On April 10, during a performance on the
              Assassination Vacation Tour, he announced he was working on a new
              album. On June 8, Drake appeared on Chris Brown's single "No
              Guidance". On June 15, Drake released two songs, "Omertà" and
              "Money in the Grave", on his EP The Best in the World Pack to
              celebrate the NBA Championship win of the Toronto Raptors. On
              August 2, he released the compilation album Care Package,
              consisting of songs released between 2010 and 2016 that were
              initially unavailable for purchase or commercial streaming; it
              debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. <br /><br />

              Drake released the song "War" on December 24, 2019, with an
              accompanying music video, which was widely noted for its UK
              drill-inspired instrumental. The following day, in an interview
              with Rap Radar, it was revealed that he was in the process of
              completing his sixth studio album. On January 10, 2020, Drake

              free after being leaked. On February 29, Drake released the songs
              "When to Say When" and "Chicago Freestyle" with a combined music
              video. On April 3, he released "Toosie Slide" with a music video,
              which features a dance created in collaboration with social media
              influencer Toosie. It debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot
              100, making Drake the first male artist to have three songs debut
              at number one.

              summer of 2020. The mixtape is a compilation of new songs and
              tracks that leaked on the internet. It received mixed reviews and

              a week later, on his 34th birthday, Drake announced Certified

              Table for One on Sirius XM, he announced a poetry book with
              frequent writing collaborator Kenza Samir in 2022, and a yet
              undetermined release of the third iteration of his Scary Hours EP
              series. Honestly, Nevermind sold 204,000 album-equivalent units in
              its first week, becoming Drake's eleventh US number-one album and
              making him the fifth artist with over 10 number one albums, after
              the Beatles (19), Jay-Z (14), Bruce Springsteen, and Barbra
              Streisand (both 11). It was also the fourth-largest streaming week
              for any album in 2022, after Un Verano Sin Ti, Mr. Morale & The
              Big Steppers, and I Never Liked You. "Jimmy Cooks" also became
              Drake's eleventh US number-one song, although, the song "Texts Go
              Green" tied the record (held by Kendrick Lamar and Taylour Paige's
              "We Cry Together") for biggest single-week drop in Billboard Hot
              100 history, falling from number 13 to number 94.
              <br /><br />
              On July 14, it was announced Drake would reunite with former Young
              Money label mates Lil Wayne and Nicki Minaj on a three date
              Toronto exclusive concert series titled the "October World
              Weekend", on July 28, July 29, and August 1. The concerts are also
              set to feature both Chris Brown and Lil Baby, and is expected to
              be the first leg of the Road to OVO Fest Tour, a worldwide edition
              of OVO Fest to commemorate its 10th anniversary. On July 29, Drake
              was revealed as a collaborator on Beyoncé's Renaissance (2022),
              co-writing the song "Heated". On August 2, the music video for
              "Sticky", the second single from Honestly, Nevermind, was
              released. After the debut of "Staying Alive" on the US Billboard
              Hot 100, it marked the 30th Drake song to reach the top five on
              the chart, breaking a 55-year-old record for most songs to reach
              the top five on the chart (29), held by The Beatles. On October 5,
              2022, Drake, in conjunction with SiriusXM, announced a special
              two-night live concert at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York
              for November 11 and 12; these were first delayed to that December
              and then delayed to January 2023, citing production delays. Drake
              then refused to submit his solo music for consideration at the
              2023 Grammy Awards, refusing to submit his music for Grammy
              consideration for a second consecutive year. At the 2022 SOCAN
              Awards, Drake won Songwriter of the Year. <br /><br />
              On October 22, Drake announced Her Loss, a collaborative album
              with 21 Savage which would release on October 28; it was then
              delayed to November 4 after Drake's longtime producer, 40, was
              diagnosed with COVID-19. At the 2022 People's Choice Awards, Drake
              was nominated for three awards: Male Artist of 2022, Song of 2022
              (for "Wait for U" with Future and Tems), and Collaboration Song of
              2022 (for "Jimmy Cooks" with 21 Savage). Her Loss debuted atop the
              Billboard 200, accumlating first week sales of 404,000
              album-equivalent units. Eight of the album's songs debuted in the
              top ten on the Billboard Hot 100, extending Drake's record for
              most top ten entries, with 67 (with a record 49 as a lead artist).
              He is also the only artist to log eight top tens from one album
              twice. On November 15, Drake was nominated for four awards at the
              2023 Grammy Awards: Album of the Year (for his writing on
              Beyoncé's Renaissance), Best Melodic Rap Performance (for "Wait
              for U"), and two for Best Rap Song (for "Churchill Downs" with
              Jack Harlow, and "Wait for U"). A day later, he released the music
              video for "Rich Flex" from Her Loss. <br /><br />
              On January 6, 2023, Drake featured on "We Caa Done", the lead
              single to Popcaan's fifth studio album Great Is He (2023). In an
              interview that same month, producer Metro Boomin revealed he
              rejected the verse Drake recorded for the song "Trance" for his
              album Heroes & Villains (2022). On February 24, the music video
              for the song "Spin Bout U" from Her Loss was released. Four days
              later, he was announced to headline that year's Dreamville
              Festival, to take place on April 1-2 at Dorothea Dix Park in
              Raleigh, North Carolina.
