              <hr />
              Noah Olivier Smith, born February 26 2000, known professionally as
              Yeat, is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, and record
              producer. He gained recognition in mid-2021 after the release of
              his mixtape 4L and debut studio album Up 2 Me, with tracks from
              the latter, including "Money So Big" and "Get Busy" gaining
              popularity on TikTok. <br /><br />
              In 2022, he released his second studio album 2 Alive, and the EP
              Lyfe; both projects debuted in the top ten on the Billboard 200.
              In 2023, he released his third studio album, Afterlyfe, which
              debuted at number four on the Billboard 200.
              <div class="text-header">Early life</div>
              <hr />
              Noah Olivier Smith was born on February 26, 2000, in Irvine,
              California. Smith is of Romanian descent through his mother and
              Mexican and European-American descent through his father. In an
              interview with Our Generation Music, he stated his paternal
              grandmother is from Mexico and is from the Mexican city of Tijuana
              while his paternal grandfather is white but he does not know what
              his grandfather's specific ethnic background is. Yeat has two
              brothers, Luca and Ethan. Yeat spent his childhood in Fullerton,
              California before he and his family moved to Portland, Oregon, he
              attended Lakeridge High School in Lake Oswego, Oregon. After
              graduating, Yeat moved to New York City to pursue his music career
              before eventually moving to Los Angeles, where he currently lives.
              <div class="text-header">Career</div>
              <hr />
              <span>2015–2021: Career beginnings</span><br /><br />
              Yeat began his career in 2015, originally making music under the
              name Lil Yeat, but these releases have since been deleted from the
              Internet. On June 30, 2018, Yeat made his first public appearance
              under his current moniker, premiering a track called "Brink" on
              Elevator, a YouTube channel. Yeat has stated that he created the
              name Yeat while high and trying to come up with one word that
              sounds familiar to people. His stage name has also been described
              as a combination of "yeet" and "heat". Yeat has mentioned how his
              use of LSD was able to help him pursue his music career. He
              released his first mixtape, Deep Blue Strips on September 20,
              2018. On February 21, 2019, he premiered the music video for his
              track "Stay Up" on Elevator. <br /><br />
              <span>2021–2022: Viral success, Up 2 Me and 2 Alive</span>
              <br /><br />
              Yeat achieved viral success online through platforms such as
              TikTok in 2021. Writing for Pitchfork, Mano Sundaresan commented
              "Cutting his teeth in the influential online rap collective
              Slayworld over the last few years, Yeat was always a little
              stranger than his peers, and consequently cast as a minor figure.
              But in 2021, his surrealist bent became his superpower." Yeat's
              music began to gain traction online following his 4L mixtape,
              which was released June 11, 2021. The 4L project notably included
              "Sorry Bout That" and "Money Twerk".
              <br /><br />
              In August, he released the EP Trendi which had increased success
              with "Mad Bout That" and "Fukit". Also in August, a snippet of his
              song "Get Busy" went viral online, attracting considerable media
              and fan attention upon its release. The song was particularly
              cited by media outlets for its line "this song already was turnt
              but here's a bell", which was immediately followed by the ringing
              of church bells (which are often incorporated into his songs).
              Fellow rappers Drake and Lil Yachty also referenced the line.
              <br /><br />
              On September 10, Yeat released his debut studio album Up 2 Me
              through an initial one-album deal with Interscope Records and
              Foundation Media. The album received generally positive reception
              from critics. After the limited Interscope and Foundation deal had
              ended, Yeat fulfilled a promise he made to Zack Bia by signing
              with the latter's Field Trip Recordings, in addition to Conor
              Ambrose's Listen to the Kids, in a joint venture with Geffen
              Records and Interscope Records. <br /><br />
              On January 22, 2022, Up 2 Me made its debut on the Billboard 200,
              initially reaching number 183 and ultimately peaking at number 58.
              Later that same month, Yeat teased a mid-February release date for
              his next album, 2 Alive. His song "U Could Tell" was featured in
              the Euphoria episode "You Who Cannot See, Think of Those Who Can",
              which premiered on January 30. <br /><br />
              On February 11, the single "Still Countin" was released alongside
              a Cole Bennett-directed music video. On February 18, Yeat released
              his second studio album, 2 Alive, through Geffen Records, Field
              Trip Recordings, Listen to the Kids, and Twizzy Rich. It debuted
              and peaked at number six on the Billboard 200, selling around
              36,000 units and becoming his highest charting project. On April
              1, the deluxe version of 2 Alive, titled 2 Alive (Geek Pack), was
              released. On April 29, he released "No Handoutz", a collaborative
              single with Internet Money Records.
              <br /><br />
              On June 28, Yeat released "Rich Minion", a single he was
              commissioned to create for a Lyrical Lemonade-produced trailer
              promoting the film Minions: The Rise of Gru. After its release,
              the song became associated with "GentleMinions", a meme involving
              people who would dress in formal attire and attend screenings of
              the film while it was playing in movie theatres during the summer
              of 2022. <br /><br />
              <span>2022–present: Lyfe and Afterlyfe</span> <br /><br />
              On September 2, 2022, Yeat released "Talk", a single from his EP
              Lyfe. The EP itself was released a week later on September 9,
              debuting and peaking at number ten on the Billboard 200.
              <br /><br />
              On October 21, Yeat was featured on rapper YoungBoy Never Broke
              Again's song "I Don't Text Back", a track included on the latter's
              mixtape Ma' I Got a Family. <br /><br />
              On February 24, 2023, Yeat released his third studio album,
              Afterlyfe. The album includes a feature from YoungBoy Never Broke
              Again, in addition to Yeat's alter egos Kranky Kranky and Luh
              Geeky. It peaked at number four on the Billboard 200 and number
              one on the Billboard Rap Albums chart. <br /><br />
              <div class="text-header">Musical style</div>
              <hr />
              Yeat began making music that had Auto-Tune-infused vocals. In
              2021, he adopted a more aggressive and synth-based sound, joining
              a growing group of rappers that used "rage beats", a sound that
              became a SoundCloud staple influenced by the lively vocal
              deliveries and EDM-influenced beat selections of artists such as
              Playboi Carti, specifically on Whole Lotta Red (2020). His vocal
              style has drawn comparisons to Playboi Carti, Future, and Young
              Thug. Yeat has stated the latter two are some of his biggest
              inspirations. He also cited American rapper T-Pain as one of his
              biggest influences growing up, calling him "The GOAT of
              Auto-Tune". Yeat's signature vocal preset is based on a vocal
              chain given to him by frequent collaborator and fellow musician
              Weiland. <br /><br />
              Yeat has also been noted to employ a unique lingo in his music,
              coming up with ad-libs and phrases such as "twizzy", "krank", and
              "luh geeky", and often referencing Tonka in his lyrics. His father
              was one of the inspirations for him creating these unique words,
              as he himself would make up his own words when Yeat was a child.
              <br /><br />
              Certain aspects of Yeat's music have led him to be associated with
              various Internet memes and trends, especially the frequent use of
              bell sounds in his music. <br /><br />
