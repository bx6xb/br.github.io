        Noah Olivier Smith, born February 26 2000, known professionally as Yeat,
        is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, and record producer. He gained
        recognition in mid-2021 after the release of his mixtape 4L and debut
        studio album Up 2 Me, with tracks from the latter, including "Money So
        Big" and "Get Busy" gaining popularity on TikTok. <br /><br />
        In 2022, he released his second studio album 2 Alive, and the EP Lyfe;
        both projects debuted in the top ten on the Billboard 200. In 2023, he
        released his third studio album, Afterlyfe, which debuted at number four
        on the Billboard 200.
        <div class="text-header">Early life</div>
        <hr />
        Noah Olivier Smith was born on February 26, 2000, in Irvine, California.
        Smith is of Romanian descent through his mother and Mexican and
        European-American descent through his father. In an interview with Our
        Generation Music, he stated his paternal grandmother is from Mexico and
        is from the Mexican city of Tijuana while his paternal grandfather is
        white but he does not know what his grandfather's specific ethnic
        background is. Yeat has two brothers, Luca and Ethan. Yeat spent his
        childhood in Fullerton, California before he and his family moved to
        Portland, Oregon, he attended Lakeridge High School in Lake Oswego,
        Oregon. After graduating, Yeat moved to New York City to pursue his
        music career before eventually moving to Los Angeles, where he currently
        lives.
        <div class="text-header">Career</div>
        <hr />
        <span>2015–2021: Career beginnings</span><br /><br />
        Yeat began his career in 2015, originally making music under the name
        Lil Yeat, but these releases have since been deleted from the Internet.
        On June 30, 2018, Yeat made his first public appearance under his
        current moniker, premiering a track called "Brink" on Elevator, a
        YouTube channel. Yeat has stated that he created the name Yeat while
        high and trying to come up with one word that sounds familiar to people.
        His stage name has also been described as a combination of "yeet" and
        "heat". Yeat has mentioned how his use of LSD was able to help him
        pursue his music career. He released his first mixtape, Deep Blue Strips
        on September 20, 2018. On February 21, 2019, he premiered the music
        video for his track "Stay Up" on Elevator. <br /><br />
        <span>2021–2022: Viral success, Up 2 Me and 2 Alive</span> <br /><br />
        Yeat achieved viral success online through platforms such as TikTok in
        2021. Writing for Pitchfork, Mano Sundaresan commented "Cutting his
        teeth in the influential online rap collective Slayworld over the last
        few years, Yeat was always a little stranger than his peers, and
        consequently cast as a minor figure. But in 2021, his surrealist bent
        became his superpower." Yeat's music began to gain traction online
        following his 4L mixtape, which was released June 11, 2021. The 4L
        project notably included "Sorry Bout That" and "Money Twerk".
        <br /><br />
        In August, he released the EP Trendi which had increased success with
        "Mad Bout That" and "Fukit". Also in August, a snippet of his song "Get
        Busy" went viral online, attracting considerable media and fan attention
        upon its release. The song was particularly cited by media outlets for
        its line "this song already was turnt but here's a bell", which was
        immediately followed by the ringing of church bells (which are often
        incorporated into his songs). Fellow rappers Drake and Lil Yachty also
        referenced the line. <br /><br />
        On September 10, Yeat released his debut studio album Up 2 Me through an
        initial one-album deal with Interscope Records and Foundation Media. The
        album received generally positive reception from critics. After the
        limited Interscope and Foundation deal had ended, Yeat fulfilled a
        promise he made to Zack Bia by signing with the latter's Field Trip
        Recordings, in addition to Conor Ambrose's Listen to the Kids, in a
        joint venture with Geffen Records and Interscope Records. <br /><br />
        On January 22, 2022, Up 2 Me made its debut on the Billboard 200,
        initially reaching number 183 and ultimately peaking at number 58. Later
        that same month, Yeat teased a mid-February release date for his next
        album, 2 Alive. His song "U Could Tell" was featured in the Euphoria
        episode "You Who Cannot See, Think of Those Who Can", which premiered on
        January 30. <br /><br />
        On February 11, the single "Still Countin" was released alongside a Cole
        Bennett-directed music video. On February 18, Yeat released his second
        studio album, 2 Alive, through Geffen Records, Field Trip Recordings,
        Listen to the Kids, and Twizzy Rich. It debuted and peaked at number six
        on the Billboard 200, selling around 36,000 units and becoming his
        highest charting project. On April 1, the deluxe version of 2 Alive,
        titled 2 Alive (Geek Pack), was released. On April 29, he released "No
        Handoutz", a collaborative single with Internet Money Records.
        <br /><br />
        On June 28, Yeat released "Rich Minion", a single he was commissioned to
        create for a Lyrical Lemonade-produced trailer promoting the film
        Minions: The Rise of Gru. After its release, the song became associated
        with "GentleMinions", a meme involving people who would dress in formal
        attire and attend screenings of the film while it was playing in movie
        theatres during the summer of 2022. <br /><br />
        <span>2022–present: Lyfe and Afterlyfe</span> <br /><br />
        On September 2, 2022, Yeat released "Talk", a single from his EP Lyfe.
        The EP itself was released a week later on September 9, debuting and
        peaking at number ten on the Billboard 200. <br /><br />
        On October 21, Yeat was featured on rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again's
        song "I Don't Text Back", a track included on the latter's mixtape Ma' I
        Got a Family. <br /><br />
        On February 24, 2023, Yeat released his third studio album, Afterlyfe.
        The album includes a feature from YoungBoy Never Broke Again, in
        addition to Yeat's alter egos Kranky Kranky and Luh Geeky. It peaked at
        number four on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Billboard Rap
        Albums chart. <br /><br />
        <div class="text-header">Musical style</div>
        <hr />
        Yeat began making music that had Auto-Tune-infused vocals. In 2021, he
        adopted a more aggressive and synth-based sound, joining a growing group
        of rappers that used "rage beats", a sound that became a SoundCloud
        staple influenced by the lively vocal deliveries and EDM-influenced beat
        selections of artists such as Playboi Carti, specifically on Whole Lotta
        Red (2020). His vocal style has drawn comparisons to Playboi Carti,
        Future, and Young Thug. Yeat has stated the latter two are some of his
        biggest inspirations. He also cited American rapper T-Pain as one of his
        biggest influences growing up, calling him "The GOAT of Auto-Tune".
        Yeat's signature vocal preset is based on a vocal chain given to him by
        frequent collaborator and fellow musician Weiland. <br /><br />
        Yeat has also been noted to employ a unique lingo in his music, coming
        up with ad-libs and phrases such as "twizzy", "krank", and "luh geeky",
        and often referencing Tonka in his lyrics. His father was one of the
        inspirations for him creating these unique words, as he himself would
        make up his own words when Yeat was a child. <br /><br />
        Certain aspects of Yeat's music have led him to be associated with
        various Internet memes and trends, especially the frequent use of bell
        sounds in his music. <br /><br />
