              <h2 class="text-header">Biography</h2>
              <hr />
              Jordan Terrell Carter, born September 13 1996, known
              professionally as Playboi Carti, is an American rapper. Carter was
              initially signed to local underground label Awful Records prior to
              signing with ASAP Mob's AWGE Label under Interscope Records. After
              gaining a cult following early in his career, Carter garnered
              mainstream attention in 2017.
              <br /><br />Carter's debut mixtape was released in April 2017, and
              included the Billboard Hot 100 charting singles "Magnolia" and
              "Woke Up Like This" (featuring Lil Uzi Vert). His debut studio
              album Die Lit (2018) peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard 200.
              Following a two-year hiatus with little-to-no new music released,
              Carter's highly anticipated second album, Whole Lotta Red (2020),
              debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and became his first
              chart-topping release.<br /><br />
              Aside from his solo career, Carter established his Opium record
              label in 2019 which has since signed artists such as Ken Carson
              and Destroy Lonely.
              <h2 class="text-header">Early life</h2>
              <hr />
              Jordan Terrell Carter was born in Atlanta and grew up in the
              nearby suburb Riverdale, Georgia. In a 2016 interview with
              Complex, he stated, "My ma couldn't tell me shit. Nobody could
              tell me shit." This type of lifestyle influenced Carter to get
              into trouble as a youth and sway away from the idea of pursuing a
              higher level of education after high school. He attended North
              Springs Charter High School in Sandy Springs.<br /><br />
              Before rap, Carter wanted to become an NBA star to try and make
              something of himself. In an interview with The Fader, he said, "I
              was a young AI and didn't go to practice. That was the time I was
              really ducking school and it was all hoop and no rap. I would
              smoke before practice, get on the court and drop 30." He stopped
              playing basketball after a disagreement with his coach. He then
              dedicated his time to music. <br /><br />Carter skipped high
              school classes regularly to work on his music or go to his job at
              H&M, which led to Carti barely graduating high school. In an
              interview with The Fader, he said, "I was in class with freshmen
              finishing work, and if I finished the nine assignments before this
              time I could graduate." He was so close to not graduating that no
              one showed up to his graduation, because they didn't know it was
              actually going to take place. <br /><br />Carter developed a
              unique fashion sense from an early age, shopping in thrift stores.
              He told Vogue that he was teased for being an early adopter of new
              styles, such as colored skinny jeans.
              <h2 class="text-header">Career</h2>
              <hr />
              <span>2011–2016: Beginnings</span><br /><br />
              Carti began rapping at an early age under the name Sir Cartier in
              2011. He changed it to Playboi Carti in 2013. He began uploading
              songs on SoundCloud in 2011. In 2014, after meeting producer
              Ethereal, he joined Awful Records. Carti credits Ethereal with
              helping him find his sound. Once Carti chose to pursue music
              full-time, he made the decision to move to New York City with some
              family.<br /><br />
              While in New York City, Carti stayed at his drug dealer's house,
              and members of ASAP Mob frequented the house. Carti ran into ASAP
              Bari, who introduced him to ASAP Rocky. Carti decided to go to
              Texas with ASAP Rocky. He began to attract attention in 2015 with
              his singles "Broke Boi" and "Fetti" featuring Da$h and Maxo Kream,
              both of which were published to SoundCloud. <br /><br />Around
              this time, Carti frequently collaborated with artists in Atlanta's
              underground rap scene, including UnoTheActivist, Thouxanbanfauni,
              Yung Bans, Lil Yachty, Ethereal, and producers MexikoDro, and
              ICYTWAT. He began to tour with ASAP Ferg and Lil Uzi Vert, and he
              signed a deal with Interscope Records. <br /><br />In 2016, he was
              featured on the A$AP Mob's single "Telephone Calls" from their
              album Cozy Tapes Vol. 1: Friends. The same year, Carti signed to
              the A$AP Mob's AWGE imprint. <br /><br />On March 3, 2023, Playboi
              Carti started day 1 of Rolling Loud California. During the set he
              performed the unreleased song "Rockstar" an unreleased track off
              Music.<br /><br />
              <span>2017–2018: Playboi Carti and Die Lit</span><br /><br />
              Carti released his eponymous debut mixtape in April 2017. The
              release gained attention from various music publications,
              including XXL, Pitchfork, Spin, HotNewHipHop, and PopMatters, and
              reached No. 12 on the Billboard 200. The mixtape spawned two
              successful singles: "Magnolia", which reached number 29 on the
              Billboard Hot 100, and "wokeuplikethis*" featuring Lil Uzi Vert,
              which reached number 76.<br /><br />
              Accompanying the mixtape's release, Carti embarked on a tour with
              Gucci Mane and Dreezy. In June 2017, Playboi Carti was named as
              one of the ten of XXL's "2017 Freshman Class". Around this time,
              he was featured on A$AP Mob's single "Raf" from their album Cozy
              Tapes Vol. 2: Too Cozy and Lana Del Rey's single "Summer Bummer"
              from her album Lust for Life.<br /><br />
              In May 2018, Carti released his debut full-length album Die Lit,
              which peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard 200. Months later, in
              August 2018, Carti announced his second studio album Whole Lotta
              Red.<br /><br />
              <span>2019–present: Whole Lotta Red and Music</span><br /><br />
              Carti began work on his second album Whole Lotta Red late in 2018.
              Over the next two years, many of Carti's songs were leaked onto
              the internet and accumulated tens of millions of streams. He did
              not release any original music, instead being featured on numerous
              singles, including "Baguettes in the Face" featuring NAV and A
              Boogie wit da Hoodie from DJ Mustard's album and "Earfquake" by
              Tyler the Creator. In April 2020, Carti released his first new
              music since 2018 with the song "@ Meh", which peaked at number 35
              on the Hot 100. <br /><br />The following month, he was featured
              on the single "Pain 1993" by Drake, which debuted at number 7 on
              the Billboard Hot 100 and became Carti's first top-ten on the
              chart. In November 2020, Carti announced that Whole Lotta Red was
              complete and had been submitted to his label. On Thanksgiving Day,
              2020, Carti was featured on Lil Yachty's deluxe album Lil Boat 3.5
              on the song "Flex Up" with Future. The following month, hip-hop
              commentator DJ Akademiks announced that Whole Lotta Red was
              scheduled for a Christmas Day release. Carter confirmed the
              Christmas release date on December 21, 2020. On December 25, 2020,
              Carti released the 24-track long album Whole Lotta Red.<br /><br />
              It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming Carti's
              first chart-topping release. In June 2021, Carti was featured on
              rapper Lil 1 DTE's single, "Homixide" from his self-titled
              mixtape. In August 2021, Playboi Carti was featured on the songs
              "Off the Grid", "Junya", and "Junya, Pt. 2" in Kanye West's album
              Donda. <br /><br />On December 25, 2022, Carti came back to
              Twitter after over a year, making tweets, like "Hello Twitter",
              and "love all my supporters it's time", possibly hinting at
              another Christmas Day release alike to his second studio album,
              Whole Lotta Red in 2020. <br /><br />On February 21, 2023, Atlanta
              DJ Swamp Izzo talked about Carter's next album in an interview,
              stating: "Playboi Carti album is done". And that it would be
              getting released in the Summer.<br /><br />
              On March 3, 2023, Playboi Carti started day 1 of Rolling Loud
              California. During the set he performed "Rockstar" an unreleased
              track off Music.<br /><br />
              <span>Fashion and modeling</span><br /><br />
              Carter's fashion style is one of the main features of his public
              image. He has called himself a "thrift store kid" and often
              prefers vintage garments. GQ has defined Carter as the "leader of
              a youth style", and said that he represents a stylistic midpoint
              between the "fashion gloss of A$AP Mob, the punk-rock attitude of
              Uzi Vert, and the playful camp of Yachty."<br /><br />
              Carter's favorite designer label is Balmain and his favorite
              designer is Raf Simons, whom he met at a 2017 fashion show in New
              York City. Carter is featured on the song "RAF" by A$AP Mob, which
              was dedicated to Raf Simons. The music video for the song included
              Carter, A$AP Rocky, and Quavo wearing rare Raf Simons-designed
              clothing. In 2017, Carter told Vogue that he considers Kanye West
              and A$AP Rocky his fashion inspirations.<br /><br />
              Carter has modeled numerous times, including Louis Vuitton at
              Paris Fashion Week, Kanye West's Yeezy Season 5, VFiles, and
              Drake's OVO Lookbook alongside Ian Connor and John Ross.
              <div class="text-header">Musical style</div>
              <hr />
              Carter has been described as a "mumble rapper", and his music as
              "playful, hard-hitting, and very melodic." Complex called his
              style of rapping "spare and repetitive, more concerned with flow
              and catchy phrases." Briana Younger at Pitchfork said that
              "Carti's music is less about lyricism and more about atmosphere",
              going on to say that "whatever Carti lacks in substance he makes
              up in sheer audacity."
              <br /><br />Carter is known for his "baby voice" technique,
              characterized by his voice hitting high pitches with unclear
              pronunciations and frantic cadences. He has used this technique on
              popular songs such as "Almeda" with Solange, "Earfquake" with
              Tyler, the Creator, and "Pissy Pamper" with Young Nudy and Pi'erre
              Bourne.<br /><br />
              The New York Times said Carti's rapping made it appear as if he
              was "more at ease with the performance of the role than with the
              actual act of rapping." <br /><br />He uses Satanic imagery. His
              style is influenced by vampire movies. Lil Wayne inspired him to
              freestyle all of his raps. <br /><br />He is influenced by A$AP
              Rocky, Kanye West, Jay-Z, MF DOOM, Slayer, Sex Pistols and Kiss.
              <br /><br />Carter is known for his rock star persona and lyrical
              focus on sex and drugs.

              rapper who rose to fame after appearing in the music video for
              "Bad and Boujee" by Migos. He allegedly shot a gun at Rose after
              she hid his phones before a flight. They broke up after Carter
              cheated on her with Blac Chyna.<br /><br />

              moved in together in the Buckhead neighborhood of Atlanta. In

              2019. In December 2020, Azalea revealed Carter had cheated on her
              and missed her son's birth. Carter refused to sign their son's
              birth certificate.<br /><br />
